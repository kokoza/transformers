    "# Bi-directional Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "We've explored both dot-product attention, and self-attention. Where dot-product compared two sequences, and self attention compared previous tokens from the *same sequence*, bidirectional attention compares tokens from the *same sequence* in both directions, subsequent and previous. This is as simple as performing the exact same operation that we performed for *self-attention*, but excluding the masking operation - allowing each word to be mapped to every other word in the same sequence. So, we could call this *bi-directional **self** attention*. This is particularly useful for masked language modeling - and is used in BERT (**Bidirectional Encoder** Representations from Transformers) - bidirectional self-attention refers to the *bidirectional encoder*, or the *BE* of BERT.\n",
