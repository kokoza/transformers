    "With dot-product attention, we calculated the alignment between word vectors from two different sequences - perfect for translation. Self-attention takes a different approach, here we compare words to previous words in the *same sequence*. So, where with dot-product attention we took our queries **Q** and keys **K** from two different sequences, self-attention takes them from the same sequence. Transformer models that look at previous tokens and try to predict the next include both text generation, and summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, just like before with dot-product attention, we calculate the dot-product again - this time taking **Q** and **K** from the same sequence.\n",

    "After calculating the dot-product across all items in the sequence, we apply a mask to remove all values calculated for future words - leaving us with the dot-product between past words only. Next, we take the softmax just as before, and multiply the result by **V** to get our attention **Z**."
