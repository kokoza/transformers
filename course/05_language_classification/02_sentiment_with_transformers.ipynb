We will be performing sentiment analysis on posts from */r/investing* (in this section we will be using the example given in `txt` below), which are finance oriented, so we can use the [finBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10063) model [`ProsusAI/finbert`](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) which has been trained on financial articles for financial sentiment classification.\n",
