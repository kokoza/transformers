Seems like getting Treasury Bonds is one route but I would ideally not want to open another account deal with separate tax forms etc.. 

Will an ETF like SHY give me similar yield and tax benefits (i.e. no state+local taxes) ? Are there any other risks with the ETF?  If you have any resources that explain how Treasury ETFs actually work that would be great as well.

t3_yu7ydh|1668360216.0|investing|After the cyber-attack on FTX, isn't it dangerous to buy bitcoin on P2P platforms?|"On P2P platforms, bitcoin is exchanged anonymously between a seller and a buyer directly and anonymously. Knowing that on the bitcoin blockchain the transactions are public. The hacker or FTX hackers can exchange the stolen bitcoins on this type of platform with an honest user. The fact of including one of the hacker's addresses in your transactions can make you a potential suspect and when exchanging your bitcoins on another platform such as Binance, Kraken, Coinbase or others, your identity will be disclosed. It's just my opinion, the fact of trading on P2P platforms or directly with an anonymous bitcoin seller may not be a danger.

I recently came into a $360.000 investment. I've been following the stock market for quite some time and been dabbling with much smaller sums. On drying that seems certain for me is that there's a lot of volatility right now, and uncertainty about the next 12-ish months. Seems like inflation is steadily peaking and the fed is going to be easing up on the rate hikes. However, am i correct to understand that the consequences of the high rates and inflation have yet to really hit the marker? 

It's a bit daunting to start investing with larger sums of money so i thought I'd run my plan by you guys, see what comes up. Any insights are highly appreciated.

I'm planning on eventually splitting the money between stocks/bonds about 65/35 ( 240/120k), and a small sum for crypto. I won't be picking individual stocks, but will go for broad ETFs. Currently thinking of 
- 40% world
- 30% s&amp;p500
- 10% europe
- 5% emerging markets
- 5% health
- 5% energy
- 5% tech.

Given the high volatility and probability of another dip in the next year, I'd prefer to transition to ETFs slowly. Of the 240k allotted for etf's, I'd keep about 100k immediately available to ease into ETFs at ±10.000 a month (sometimes more, sometimes less depending on the situation at the time, but every month without fault) for the first 6 months of 2023. The other 140 I'd invest in short terms bonds (±6 months). So they become available when i need them at the 6 month mark. At that point i decide how to proceed ( get into ETFs quicker or again invest a percentage in short term bonds an repeat the proces), from there with hopefully a little more certainty about the state of the market.

My thinking is that this way i get the secure, relatively high returns from the short term bonds while easing into etf's and still having a small buffer available to invest larger sums should the market take a dive. Overall, I'd reach the 65/35 etf/bond ratio and become fully invested in 18-24 months. 

Ver interested to hear your thoughts. Any i sights are highly appreciated.

Thank you."|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0

I had an exchange with someone who says that instead of picking individual stocks, just invest in $SPY or $VOO. Of course, I also see $SCHD pumped on another sub. It actually takes the fun out of these subs, because there is no originality in the thinking.

Here's the thing, there are so many other ETFs that have outperformed these indices since 2000. Note: $SPY has returned an annualized 6.4% since the beginning of 2000. Here are three index funds that have been the better option:

SPDR S&amp;P Midcap 400 ETF ($MDY)--9.2% annual return.

SPDR Gold Shares ($GLD)--7.8% annual return.

iShares Russell 2000 ETF ($IWM)--7.3% annual return.

This is return data from the last ~23 years, so this isn't just short term trends. These are generational returns that are outside the S&amp;P 500.

Before I do, I like to keep the returns of the indices in mind. It is the only for me to determine whether my methods are still working or not. Just so you know, I invest only in equities, including gold mining, REITs, and hedging ETFs. I do not invest in bonds, but I will keep some cash on hand in case there is an opportunity too good to pass.  Thank you Elon Musk for the nice little Twitter bonus. I also use covered calls with one year contracts to enhance my income. I only rebalance and reassess the third Friday in January. That keeps me from being totally reactive to market gyrations.

Based on total return, the S&amp;P 500 is down -15.1% this year. The Vanguard Total Bond Fund is down -15.69% this year. If that holds up, it would be an example proving that this is the worst year for bonds since 1793 (yes, you read that right). 

So far this year, I am only down 11%.  I know that is not something to write home about, but I will write it down here, it does give me faith that what I did work. The key is focus on quality companies that generate growing revenues, increasing profits, and have strong balance sheets.  I do use some literal calculus to determine a fair present value, so I don't overpay on my holdings.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company owned by Warren Buffett, has sold 5.78 million Hong Kong-listed shares of electric vehicle maker BYD for HK$1.14 billion ($145.38 million), a stock exchange filing showed.

&amp;#x200B;

The sale lowered Berkshire's holdings in BYD's total issued H-shares to 16.62% on Nov. 8, down from 17.15%, Friday's filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange showed.

BIZD is a business development company ETF. Very niche investment consisting of middle market lenders/equity owners. BIZD has a very high yield — 10%+ at the moment — and there is default risk in the event of recession. If those scenarios are avoided the yield pays you nicely to wait. Some BDCs can be good in a rising rate environment if the underlying loans are floating rate and the borrowers can handle the increased debt service. BIZD is down 8% on the year, nice outperformance versus major indexes. I expect the ETF to trail in raging bull markets and to sell off hard in a recession, but to generate high single-digit annual returns over time.

IFRA is the iShares infrastructure ETF. Infrastructure stocks are a steady eddy investment which tend to experience shallower drops in difficult periods. Their revenues tend to hold up because they largely derive from the public sector. IFRA is down a little under 7% YTD. This one will also trail during bull markets but I expect it to hold up nicely in the event of recession. 

HYMB is a bit of a stretch to include here because it is down 20% on the year, but I expect it to turn in a nice performance once interest rates stabilize and risk appetites return. This ETF holds high yield muni bonds — think Puerto Rico, heavily indebted parts of California and Illinois, any public debt issuer that needs to pay a premium to borrow. The reason I like this one so much is the high yield with tax advantages. Its 5% yield right now is about the same as 8% from a taxable corporate bond fund. Nice long-term hold in my taxable accounts. It might sound risky in theory to hold debt from struggling/heavily indebted municipalities but the implicit backing of states and low likelihood that more than a few default simultaneously makes this one very attractive.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffetts-berkshire-sheds-large-portion-010619287.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffetts-berkshire-sheds-large-portion-010619287.html)

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, said on Thursday it has shed more than 91 million US Bancorp shares since the start of the year, reducing its stake in the fifth-largest U.S. bank by 63%.

In a regulatory filing, Berkshire said it owned just over 53 million U.S. Bancorp shares, for a 3.6% stake, on Oct. 31, down from 144.7 million shares, or 9.8%, on Dec. 31, 2021.

Berkshire began investing in the Minneapolis-based bank in 2006, according to regulatory filings.

It did not give a reason for the reduction or say if it has sold more stock in November. Buffett does not discuss his stock purchases and sales while they are ongoing.

U.S. Bancorp and Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to requests for comment after market hours.

Shares of U.S. Bancorp closed Thursday at $44.87. They have fallen 20% this year.

Banks and other financial services companies normally comprise a large percentage of Berkshire's equity portfolio, which totaled $306.2 billion as of Sept. 30.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based company ended September with a $31.2 billion stake in Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank, and recently held large stakes in American Express Co and Bank of New York Mellon Corp.

It has in recent years also held and sold multi-billion-dollar stakes in Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Wells Fargo &amp; Co.

Apple Inc is Berkshire's largest common stock investment. Berkshire owned $126.5 billion of the iPhone maker's shares on Sept. 30.

On Nov. 14, Berkshire is expected in a regulatory filing to disclose more information about its U.S.-listed stock holdings.

Buffett, 92, has run Berkshire since 1965. The conglomerate also owns several dozen companies including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurer, energy and industrial businesses, and consumer products such as Dairy Queen ice cream.

CZ, the CEO of Binance, tweeted out that they would unwind the FTT position they held which was quite large, because CZ said FTX's books were suspect. Sam Bankman- ~~Fraud~~ Fried (SBF) , the CEO of FTX, tweeted out that all was fine, no problems, they had the capital to back up FTT. 

A week later SBF admitted that FTX was insolvent and begged CZ to bail them out. CZ said Binance would absorb FTX's holdings. Then CZ got a look at the books and changed his mind, letting FTX and SBF to twist in the wind. FTT was trading in the 30 dollar range last month, now its worth $3 but you would be insane to buy it.

&gt;Real-estate company Redfin Corp. laid off 13% of its staff on Wednesday and closed its home-flipping unit, saying the operation was both too expensive and too risky to continue.

&gt;The Seattle-based company, which operates a real-estate brokerage and home-listings website, said the decisions were made because it is predicting that the real-estate market is going to be smaller next year and its home-flipping business is losing money. It previously laid off 8% of its workforce in June of this year.

&gt;The closure of Redfin’s home-flipping business, RedfinNow, follows Opendoor Technologies Inc. posting record losses last week. The biggest home-flipping company sold too many homes for less than their purchase price. Opendoor blamed the pace of rising interest rates for throttling the housing market faster than the company could predict.

Of course I thought that some of the CPI prints will be the catalyst for a dump. Folks like Jeremy Grantham suggest around 300-330 SPY being relatively fair value. There's obviously nothing stopping the market overreacting and it going a lot further down, but I thought hey 330 to begin to enter is a decent mental marker.

Anyway we've had some prints, I suspect tomorrow's will still be strong, and the Fed will go with the .5% hike on dec 2nd, and the market will sulk a bit more. Maybe continued high inflation prints into Feb and March will result in the market bottom.. maybe not. 

I'm then wondering about the VIX and will it hit the sky.. And it dawned on me today while browsing tradingview that the VIX might not spike at all. I noticed a token down 40% today .. something like 4 billion dollars in perceived wealth quietly wiped out over a couple days on one out of many many of these things. Property prices might pullback on rates, tokens will collapse, but the S&amp;P ? It's not that far from fair value. Unless something actually breaks in the economy I don't think VIX is gonna spike much.. And I'm not going to look to it.

Wondering if any one could help with this one. I've got most of my portfolio in broad index funds and around 10% in individual stock picks. 

I've recently done a bit of reading around Nick Sleeps' Nomad fund and I was wondering how I can find similar funds to how Nomad was structured. Specifically, I want to find funds which use a high performance fee but generally have a low annual fee. I believe that it better aligns the interests of the managers with the investors. 

I've been using IG and Hargreaves Lansdown but it's just full of invesco/blackrock/lion trust etc. funds which all just use the same higher annual fees, with a performance which is pretty similar to index funds. 

I'm more interested in funds that are concentrated, have a higher performance fee but also have a chance to perform better over the long run. 

If anyone knows any resources then please do share. Just before anyone asks, I'm currently in my late 20's with no dependents- therefore I can afford to allocate a % of my portfolio to riskier/more concentrated funds.

It looks like the rate of inflation over the last 3 months is relatively ""stable"" and hasnt been going up month to month. CPI percentage is determined by comparing CPI from the previous years CPI for that same month.   


Bear with me here -

For the last 2-3 months, the CPI of 2021 july-sept remained pretty consistent month to month and so has the CPI for 2022 july-sept.   


Now, there was a pretty big jump in CPI from september 2021 to october 2021 and since CPI % is comparing the CPI for the same month against the previous years month - in order for us to have this expected 8%-8.1% increase, we would need to see a similar jump in CPI for October.  


From my anecdotal experience, prices remain high, BUT they havnt really increased - theyve just stayed expensive...

Specifically on the ""Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows"", I pulled the Cash Flow From Operations from the **Net cash provided by operating activities** line.  For the Capital Expenditures I added up the **Net cash used in investing activities** and **Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities**.

So the two questions.  First one being, are those the correct line items to pull for the (Cash Flow From Operations - Capital Expenditures) calculation?

Secondly, assuming those are the correct line items, to get the Free Cash Flow value to start discounting into the future, I've been averaging the past ten Free Cash Flow values.  However, in such a situation like this the average is a negative ( -$19,444,444.44 ).  Which completely confuses me on how you would discount into the future.

I’ve searched and found quite few older answers to this.  My wife and I have some money managed by an Ameriprise rep in our area.  I just have a Roth with a few thousand in it right now, and the rest is in a 401k through my employer.  My wife is a contractor and has recently rolled over some funds from her previous company with this Ameriprise rep.  

We had paid him a few hundred dollars every couple of years to give us suggestions and allocate our funds.  In our most recent Zoom call with him, he said they are moving to a different fee structure for accounts like my wife’s and asked if we would be ok with that.  My Roth would not be impacted.  We said possibly and would want to take a look at the documents.  He mentioned a rate of 1.25%.  I wasn’t sure if that was based on just her account, but after reading through things, it is.  

So, the TLDR is:  is 1.25% a fair rate for this kind of service these days?  Right now that’s about 600 a year for her, but obviously would be much higher in years to come if she continues to put money into that account.

I understand the a single-price dutch auction process is used to determine the yield.

Let's use the [11/08/2022 3 Year Note results](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2022/R_20221108_1.pdf) as an example. IIUC, the important bits:

- Interest Rate: 4.5%
- High Yield: 4.605%
- Price: $99.708904
- Face Value: $100

I am guessing that the price is a function of interest rate and high yield, but do not understand exactly how. I did not study finance in school so I've been trying to pick up things from Investopedia. Let's take the example above and say I buy **1** note. Here's what I understand so far:

- If I submit a non-competitive bid for $100 worth of T-notes, I will be granted **1** T-note at a price of $99.708904.
- Interest on T-notes doesn't auto-compound. So for the example above, I will be paid $99.708904 x 4.5% x 3 years = $13.46070204 in interest if I hold the T-note to maturity.
- I also understand that T-notes pay interest every 6 months. So for the example above, it would really be 6 interest payments of 99.708904 x (4.5% / 2) = $2.24345034.
- Once the note reaches maturity, I am paid the face value. So for the example above, I would be paid $100 at the end of 3 years.
- I will thus earn $13.46070204 + $100 - $99.708904 = $13.75179804 from this T-note if I hold the T-note to maturity.

Since interest on T-notes doesn't auto-compound, I am calculating the annual (not geometric annualized) return as ($13.75179804 / $99.708904) / 3 years = 0.04597315281. This is slightly less than the high yield of 4.605%. If annualized return ($13.46070204 + $100) / $99.708904) ^ (1/3) - 1 = 0.0440080354 is even less.

Take LCID as an example for this week. This evening 11/08/2022 after the market closed LCID earnings were released. They posted a less than great earnings last quarter.

Posting good or bad earnings no longer guarantees stock will rise, in fact, it almost always means it will fall in this specific economic market.

Before we get started, I want to disclose a personal bias: I love Chipotle. It’s my favorite multinational food chain, and I will fiercely defend the quality of their products. I even used this write-up as an excuse to go to Chipotle this week. So, I want you to know that while I love Chipotle’s food, I will remain impartial in the analysis of their current and future business operations.

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is a multinational food chain that serves Mexican-style food. Its most prominent and popular dishes are burritos, burrito bowls, and tacos. Their dishes’ ingredients include flour and corn tortillas, as well as a variety of meats, vegetables, and condiment-like components. In their [most recent quarterly report](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&amp;ref=117013276&amp;type=PDF&amp;symbol=CMG&amp;companyName=Chipotle+Mexican+Grill+Inc.&amp;formType=10-Q&amp;dateFiled=2022-10-26&amp;CK=1058090), CMG says that they possess 3,090 total restaurants, having closed or relocated five locations and opened 43 new ones in the same quarter. CMG also says that they expect to open 255 to 285 new restaurants next year.

Chipotle’s business model is simple: they lease real estate, hire employees, and buy ingredients in order to make money by selling their food and beverages. My write-up will present the facts of CMG, my forecasts of CMG, and a specific price target of what I believe is a reasonable price to pay for CMG stock.

# Fundamentals

Chipotle has strong core financials. In their latest 8-K (quarterly report), they held total assets of $6.8 billion, including $366 million of cash and cash equivalents. Their liabilities sum to $4.5 billion, making their book value of equity close to $2.3 billion. Note that a chunk of their assets include $3.3 billion of operating lease assets, and $1.9 billion of capitalized leasehold improvements. So, while their balance sheet remains substantially robust, it’s not like they will have an easy time liquidating their non-current assets to finance operations or pay off debt.

Leases are part of what makes Chipotle fairly unique amongst the restaurant giants of the world. Unlike McDonald’s or Domino’s, Chipotle does not franchise. Instead, they enter leasing agreements and operate each restaurant on their own, meaning that they have complete control over how each restaurant looks and runs. Chipotle’s control over their restaurants is the biggest contributing factor towards a sense of equality between their different locations—they all look the same, they largely use the same ingredients, and the portions tend to be similar (with exceptions, of course). 

Their trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue totals to $8.4 billion. Pretty much 100% of their revenue comes from selling their food and beverages; a tiny portion of it is from delivery service fees.

Chipotle’s operating expenses have steadily climbed along with revenue. Financially speaking, Chipotle is very healthy, having accrued large positive income in almost every quarter over the last five years.

In the TTM since their Q3 report, the average restaurant sales of a Chipotle location that has been in operation for at least a year was $2.8 million. This means that, on average, a given Chipotle restaurant generates something close to $2.8 million in sales every twelve months.

# Chipotle’s branding and target demographic

Who goes to Chipotle? What demographic are they targeting? Images aren't allowed in r/investing, so instead, google ""Chipotle ads"".

Their branding shouts, “HEALTHY FAST FOOD.” They’re not trying to compete with McDonald’s, Domino’s or Burger King. Instead, Chipotle speaks to the people who want tasty food prepared quickly that isn’t as poisonous as most fast food options. I strongly believe that Chipotle’s future as a company will depend on how this demographic grows or shrinks over the years.

Given that Chipotle doesn’t use frozen foods, uses “high quality” ingredients, and purchases produce locally, their prices are justifiably higher than other fast food chains. These expenditures price out potential customers who would consider eating at Chipotle, if not for the cost. This means that Chipotle’s target demographic, “healthy eaters who want fast food”, will tend to have a higher income than other fast food goers, as Chipotle’s higher prices necessitate a higher comparative level of disposable income.

The size of Chipotle’s customer base will depend on the average consumer’s buying power: the more disposable income available, the more likely a given individual will fall into their target audience. Thus, when the economy is in an expansion, Chipotle will have more customers because there is more aggregate disposable income. Likewise, when the economy is in a recession, Chipotle will have less customers because there is less aggregate disposable income. This relationship is fairly obvious, as pretty much all levels of spending depend on the quantities of disposable income, but the important part to note is that Chipotle should be considered more of a luxury good than a normal good. For example, if the aggregate level of disposable income decreases, the size of Chipotle’s target demographic will decrease more than McDonald’s, as McDonald’s is able to engage in almost pure price discrimination (from starting at nearly $0 and upwards), while Chipotle is not because the minimum purchase involved is high. At McDonald’s, you can buy a burger for close to $3, have the option of getting a double burger, can buy small, medium, or large fries, and buy a drink; McDonald’s minimum purchase is only a few bucks, but allows bigger spenders to buy more products. Chipotle, however, has a starting price of roughly double McDonald’s—they allow bigger spenders to spend more, but they don’t capture as many smaller spenders.

These demographic changes are one of Chipotle’s most sensitive business factors.

# Chipotle’s inputs

Below, I’ve compiled every substantial ingredient I can think of that Chipotle uses to make their products. 

*Side note: please let me know if you think of any notable ingredients that I did not list.*

**Meat**

* Chicken
* Beef
* Pork

 **Vegetables**

* Bell peppers
* Tofu
* Avocado
* Lettuce
* Tomatoes
* Onions
* Black beans
* Pinto beans

 **Dairy**

* Sour cream
* Cheese

 **Grain**

* White rice
* Brown rice
* Corn
* Wheat (for tortillas)

“Food, beverage and packaging” is their largest operating cost, sitting at $662.5 million for Q3. An obvious but important influence of Chipotle’s profitability is the cost of their ingredients: when ingredients are more expensive, Chipotle makes less money, and when ingredients are cheaper, Chipotle makes more money. However, when inflation is pushing the price level upwards, it is expected that the price of goods and services, as a whole, will increase—not just food. Thus, Chipotle’s profitability as a function of the costs of their ingredients will depend on how food prices outpace inflation.

Since we don’t know exactly how Chipotle’s basket of ingredients are weighted in their total costs, we can’t create an exact function of how each ingredient will influence the total food, beverage, and packaging expense. Instead, I will use the price of “food”, in general, as a proxy.

Prior to 2020, the year when the COVID-19 pandemic first hit, food prices remained relatively stagnant, while overall prices steadily increased. Only once the supply chain issues began did food prices start to skyrocket. I don’t see why food prices should continue to increase as supply-side problems resolve. I expect that, in the long-term, food, beverage, and packaging expenses for Chipotle will decrease in comparison to revenue. It’s quite impressive that Chipotle has posted such strong operating income over the last couple years, given the circumstances.

# How will Chipotle continue to grow?

Put simply, Chipotle grows by opening new restaurants to attract customers, and by increasing the absolute number of customers that patron existing Chipotle restaurants. In their most recent quarterly earnings call, Chipotle’s CEO, Brian Niccol, confirmed that Chipotle is committed to a long-term restaurant target of 7,000. This is roughly double the current number of restaurants they have, leaving plenty of room for growth.

Chipotle has managed to increase their EBIT % margin significantly over the years; it has more than doubled from five years ago. I believe Chipotle will continue to benefit from economies of scale, and thus continue to increase their operating margin. Their most recent quarters, Q2 and Q3 of 2022, represent their most dramatic increase in profitability. In their quarterly report, CMG cited menu price increases as the most prominent reason behind it, in addition to sales revenue in general. This signals that it is profitable for Chipotle to maintain these elevated prices, even as the underlying ingredients fluctuate in cost. One of my core assumptions for Chipotle’s future business is that they will be able to continue increasing their EBIT % margin; I used 18% as a target estimate.

# Chipotle valuation

To value Chipotle, I constructed a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. My price target for CMG is **$1251.58**. This represents roughly an 11% downside from its current price at $1396.37. There are many possible reasons for this difference; I believe the most significant and probable reason is that the market’s assumptions for the future are a bit more optimistic than mine, which would create a premium. There’s also always the possibility of me being categorically wrong in my valuation.

I will not be shorting CMG at the current price—if I were to, it would only be if there was a more dramatic difference, close to 30% or 40% to compensate for its risk profile. Also, I would be happy to buy Chipotle stock if it dipped below my target price. I believe the market has reasonably priced the security, I will be watching it as a potential long/short in the future. For now, I will limit my relationship with Chipotle to being their customer, not an investor.

**TLDR:** Chipotle is a great business. I think it's slightly overvalued, and would buy if it went lower."|0.76|36.0|0.0|36.0

So most every person, myself included, when asked what someone should invest in will answer with the same thing: DCA into a diversified ETF like VTI or VOO and just let it ride. That's what I've been doing myself as it follows the conventional wisdom of not putting all your eggs into one basket, protecting yourself against massive market swings, and generally allowing an individual to take the emotion out of investing and slowly grow their wealth in a safe, predictable, and emotionless manor. 

But here's the thing, Apple is already a massive percentage of all of the diversified ETFs we recommend, and it consistently outperforms them as well. 

I'm not able to share images, but tradingview offers this really cool comparison tool. If you type in AAPL/VOO you can see how valuable Apple is compared to VOO. Since VOO launched in 2010 AAPL is now sitting at 338% more valuable across 12 years. 

Then I start thinking about the broad income streams that Apple has. They have physical products, digital products, and subscriptions that generate consistent revenue. They pay a consistently increasing dividend quarterly and maintain massive market share by being, in my opinion, an ""affordable Veblen good"" or more simply put, a bit of a status symbol. Also, anecdotally, the last three companies I've worked for are using Apple hardware in their offices. It is the go-to computer for the tech-startup world.

Now I know someone has already typed out a comment saying, ""past performance is not an indicator of future gains"" to which I say bullshit. The only reason we invest in companies, ETFs, or whatever else is because we look to the past and say, ""The line has gone up for the last 10 years, surely that means the line will continue to go up for the next 10 years.""

So yeah, in all honesty, if you're planning on buying and holding for 30 years why would you not want to go all in on Apple?"|0.3|0.0|0.0|0.0

&gt; This afternoon, FTX asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire http://FTX.com and help cover the liquidity crunch. We will be conducting a full DD in the coming days.

I don't follow the space closely but from what I gather

- Binance announced a few days ago they were selling FTX backed FTT because of issues at FTX, [causing a 30%+ crash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/) of FTT

- FTX CEO SBF (oh my) denied all this just yesterday https://mobile.twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1589598284322328579

- However reports of being unable to[ withdraw from FTX](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/ftxs-seemingly-sluggish-withdrawals-raise-eyebrows/) have started recently, along with reports that FTX has a [negative BTC balance](https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-balance-on-ftx-exchange-goes-negative-coinglass/) 

- Binance is the #1 crypto exchange while FTX is #3 creating a mega exchange (Coinbase is #2)

- To further add to the drama, if it's to be believed, Binance worked with the FSB to provide data on Putin foe Alexei Navalny https://cryptobriefing.com/binance-turned-over-user-data-to-russian-authorities-report/"|0.92|189.0|0.0|189.0

If we revert to the mean of 15 in terms of PE, we’re looking at a 25% drop from here which takes us to 2850. The scenario of complete reversion to the mean is tied to a 30 year treasury yield reverting to its long term average of 6.29%, which seems unlikely unless inflation expectations really get out of control in the next years.
So let’s say this is the worst case scenario. 

Then we have earnings contraction, latest estimates by Goldman are around 11% in the next 2 years.
That would take us from 2850 to 2536.

Would you consider 2500 a good approximation for a worst case scenario, in which earnings come down and inflation is not tamed?

I am wondering when to enter this market in a major way, and 3200 seems like a good point to start averaging down. In my mind, if the worst case is to 2500, it is a 22% decline from 3200, very bearable psichologically.

I don't know anything about annuities but I was wondering what the advantages/disadvantages they have over long term treasuries.

I'm in my 40s and in general I am pretty conservative.  I've always said if I could get a 5% gaurenteed return via fixed income, I would do it.  In recent years, that was very difficult but with the increases in interest rates, this has become more possible. 

With 30yr treasuries over 4% now, I am considering buying 30 yr bonds monthly.  Maybe $1000 per month indefinitely??  

Are there fixed annuity products out there that are better?  It's hard for me to find a clear rate on an annuity without talking to a salesman.

As of now I'm split 50/50 between the S&amp;P and a dividend cover call ETF. However, I'm hesitating because the economic conditions outside the US are deteriorating. Here're my current concerns:

* The continued rise of interest rates and the continued strengthing of the dollar will continue to hamper the economic growth of countries, especially developing countries. Sri Lanka is said to be the first domino of many.
* Food scarcity is getting worse globally. China, Ukraine and others have banned fertilizer exports. India, China, Egypt and a mayrid of other countries have banned exports of wheat, cereal, and/or other commodities. Mulitple countries have had sub par harvests as well. Argentina, India, etc. While we don't have data, I'm sure China has suffered as well due to their ongoing drought.
* China is continuing to have economic headwinds, which is especially concerning considering that they're the biggest player on the block from an international standpoint. Xi, in his infinite wisdom, is bringing back a planned economy, essentially returning the country to the days of Mao. I probably don't need to tell you how this is affecting the mindset of the country's rich and entrepreneurial. I personally don't see China surviving as it exists today by the end of the decade.

I'm sure there are a lot more factors, and while I'm aware that specualtion has the tendincy to bite people in the butt (hindsight is a bitch), I believe that these are all merited concerns. If it was only a few economies that were affected then I probably wouldn't hesitate. It's not though, these concerns are global. I personally believe that many WILL go hungry this winter, especially in import dependent countries such as Egypt.

I know there is an option to sell your T-Bills prematurely, but you are at the whim of the secondary market to put a price. This leads to caution being thrown that your T-Bills could be worth less if interest rates go up.

I feel like this correlation is a bit too simplistic. Shouldn't the value of a T-Bill be also proportional to how much it has matured? A T-Bill close to maturity is worth the $100/$1000 value so even if rates go up after purchasing, I find it incredibly hard that it loses more value to sell at a loss.

It feels like the loss function would be: \[TIME REMAINING\] x \[most analogous T-Bill maturity rates\]. So for example if I had 4 weeks left to mature on a T-Bill, I would be selling it at \[1 month\] x \[current rates for 4-week-T-Bills\].

Can someone explain what situations are realistic for auctioning T-Bills at a loss?"|0.82|10.0|0.0|10.0

# Methodology

We will compare three growth model:

1. \-5.70% Earnings' based growth model, with not legalization projected to 2026, perpetual growth
2. Arbitrary growth rate of 5% counting in legalization in 2023, projected until 2026, perpetual growth
3. Arbitrary growth counting in legalization in 2023, projected until 2026, gradual growth of 5%, 7%, 10%, 15%, with averge annual perpetual growth of 12%

# Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

# Evaluation Methods

In this post, **three evaluation methods are used** to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of -5.70%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE from 2019 to 2022 of -5.70%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2022 reported Free Cash Flow and its WACC based discounted rate of 9.62% and its Growth Rate of \[*scenatio 1; scenario 2; scenario 3*\]% to determine a fair value of:

1. $0.10
2. $0.37
3. $0.77

Note: the Scenario 2 and 3 is computed by using the assumption that the company will have positive free cash flow by end of 2023 as the managment planned, we assume a FCF of 10 milion

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated in the three scenarios.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|\[Scenario 1; Scenario 2; Scenario 3\]|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.17|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of

1. $0.45
2. $4.19
3. $6.63

&amp;#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|\[Scenario 1; Scenario 2; Scenario 3\]|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|611,402,300|

This model gives us a price tag of:

1. \-$3.22
2. $1.12
3. $4.97

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

||Fair Value|
|:-|:-|
|Scenario 1|\-0.89|
|Scenario 2|$1.89|
|Scenario 3|$4.12|
|**Average of the three scenarios**|**$1.70**|

* **Tilray Inc has a well-established IT system** that ensures efficiency in its internal and external operations.
* **Tilray Inc owns a number of intellectual property rights** that include trademarks and patents. These allow it exclusivity over its products and competitors cannot copy or reverse engineer them.
* **Tilray Inc is a brand that has been in the market for years**, and people are aware of it. This makes its brand awareness high.
* **Its products have maintained quality over the years** and are still valued by customers, who find it as good value for the amount of money that they pay.
* **Partnership**s: Strategic partnerships are established by Tilray Inc with its suppliers, dealers, retailers and other stakeholders. This allows it to leverage them if need be in the future.

## Weaknesses

* **Research and Development**: Even though Tilray Inc is spending more than the average research and development expenditure within the industry, it is spending way less than a few players within the industry that have had a significant advantage as a result of their innovative products.
* **High Day Sales Inventory**: The time it takes for products to be purchased and sold are higher than the industry average, meaning that Tilray Inc builds up on inventory adding unnecessary costs to the business.
* **Rented Property**: A significant proportion of the property that Tilray Inc owns is rented rather than purchased. It has to pay large amounts of rent on these adding to its costs.
* **Low current ratio**: The current ratio that shows the company’s ability to meet its short term financial obligations, is lower than the industry average. This could mean that the company could have liquidity problems in the future.
* **The company has low levels of current assets compared to current liabilities**, and this can create liquidity problems for it in operations.
* **Cash flow problems**: There is a lack of proper financial planning at Tilray Inc regarding cash flows, leading to certain circumstances where there isn’t enough cash flow as required leading to unnecessary unplanned borrowing.
* **Integration**: Tilray Inc's current structure and culture have resulted in the failure of various mergers aimed at vertical integration.
* **Market Research**: Tilray Inc has not conducted market research within the market that is serves since the past 2 years. As a result, it is making decisions based on years old data, while customer needs may have evolved over time.
* **High employee turnover rates**: Tilray Inc has a higher employee turnover rate compared to competitors. This means that it has more people leaving the job, and as a result, it is spending more on training and development as employees keep leaving and joining.
* **Quality Control**: Tilray Inc has a lower budget for its quality control department than competitors. This leads to lack of consistency and the possibility of damage to quality across its various outlets.
* **Lack of legal experience** and legal department employees are not highly qualified.
* **A few products have a high market share**, while most of the products have a low market share. This reliance on a few products makes Tilray Inc vulnerable to external threats if these few products suffer for any reason.
* **The workload is a high per worker** as there are fewer workers than the actual work required. This puts workers under psychological stress and is likely to be less productive.
* **Worker morale is low due to company culture** and politics that have grown in recent years.
* **Competition and qualified employees have been leaving** the organisation in recent years, which could mean a shortage of good talent for the company in the upcoming years.
* **The decision making is highly centralized**, and decisions by teams need to be approved by certain officials. This reduces efficiency in operations by making them more time consuming. It also leads to reduced innovation.
* **The performance appraisal is not in a systematic manner**. People are often not appraised for their performance. This leads to lower work morale and lack of promotion opportunities for employees.

## Opportunities

* **Internet**: there has been an increase in the number of internet users all over the world. This means that there is an opportunity for Tilray Inc to expand their presence online; by using the internet to interact with its customers.
* **E-commerce**: There has been a new trend and a growth in sales of the e-commerce industry. This means that a lot of people are now making purchases online. Tilray Inc can earn revenue by opening online stores and making sales through these.
* **Social Media**: there has been an increase in the number of social media users worldwide. The three social media platforms; Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, have shown the greatest number of increase in monthly active users. Tilray Inc can use social media to promote its products, interact with customers and collect feedback from them.
* **Technological developments**: technology comes with numerous benefits among many departments. Operations can be automated to reduce costs. Technology enables better data to be collected on customers and improves on marketing efforts.
* **Population**: the population has been growing and is expected to grow at a positive rate for the upcoming years. This is beneficial for Tilray Inc as there will be an increase in the number of potential customers that it can target.
* **Green government drive**: this provides an opportunity for Tilray Inc for the sale of Tilray Inc's products to federal and state government contractors.
* **Transport Industry**: the transport industry has been flourishing in the past few years, and shows growth potential in the future. This has reduced the costs of transportation, which is beneficial for Tilray Inc as it will lower its overall costs.
* **Tax policy:** the governments’ reduction in tax rate is beneficial for Tilray Inc as a lower amount would be expensed out as a tax.
* **Tourism:** growth in tourism is beneficial for Tilray Inc as it will provide new potential customers that it can target in order to gain market share.
* **Skilled workers:** increase in education and training by numerous institutes has increased the amount of skilled labor available within the country. This means that if Tilray Inc is able to hire skilled labor, it would have to spend less on training and development, therefore, saving costs.
* **A number of new niche markets have opened up that are growing**. Tilray Inc can sell products in these markets and take advantage.
* **Globalisation**: Increased globalisation does not restrict Tilray Inc to its own country. It can extend its operations to other countries, entering into these markets and making use of the opportunities that lie in these markets.
* **Consumers within the industry are becoming more conscious of health, and this is a segment that is growing**. Tilray Inc can take advantage by manufacturing products that are beneficial to customer's health.
* **Trade barriers have been reduced on the import of goods**. This will reduce the costs incurred on inputs for production.
* **Regulations have loosened in recent years** making it easier for businesses to carry out their operations.

## Treats

* **Technological developments by competitors**; New technological developments by a few competitors within the industry pose a threat to Tilray Inc as customer attracted to this new technology can be lost to competitors, decreasing Tilray Inc’s overall market share.
* **Suppliers:** The bargaining power of suppliers has increased over the years with the decrease in the number of suppliers. This means that the costs of inputs could increase for Tilray Inc.
* **New entrants:** there have been numerous players that have entered the market and are gaining market share by gaining existing companies’ market share. This is a threat to Tilray Inc as it can lose its customers to these new entrants.
* **Increasing competition**: there has been an increase in competition within the industry putting downward pressure on prices. This could lead to reduced revenue for Tilray Inc if it adjusts to the price changes, or loss of market share if it doesn’t.
* **Exchange Rate:** the exchange rate keeps fluctuating and this affects a company like Tilray Inc that has sales internationally, while its suppliers are local.
* **Political uncertainties** in the country prove to be a barrier in business, hindering performance at times and making the business incur unnecessary costs.
* **The fluctuating interest rates** in the country do not provide a stable financial and economic environment.
* **Consumer tastes are changing**, and this puts pressure on companies to constantly change their products to meet the needs of these customers.
* **Substitute products available are also increasing**, which is threat collectively for the whole industry as consumption of current products decrease.
* **The rise in prices of fuel** has increased in the input costs for Tilray Inc. These costs have also increased as other industries that provide inputs for this company also have suffered from increasing fuel prices, thereby charging more.
* **Increased promotions by competitors** have been a threat for Tilray Inc. On most media, there is more clutter than ever, and customers are bombarded with multiple messages. This reduces the effectiveness of promotional messages by Tilray Inc.
* **Constant technological developments require the workforce to be trained** accordingly as the inability to keep up with these changes can lead to loss of business for Tilray Inc.

# Final Considerations

**What is its future potential?**

Without Legalization, the company is destined to fail. It is burning its cash at a 2.09 rate, leaving it only 25 months of life expectancy (take in mind that this is an assumption cause obviously in those 25 months the company will have sales and other operations bringing in cash, the life expectancy is calculated on the assumption the company will not have further sales or other income of cash, so take this data as indicative).  If we assume a recover of macro data, consumption shall growth in other segments in which the company operates, cause marijuana is not its biggest nor main revenue stream. The company is well diversified of even without legalisation we shall expect to see it aroun in the next 5 years.

With Legalizaion, it is moon time baby. Its fundamentals, at the most conservative assumptions, prices it around 4$ but we all know that hype will push it further that price level bring it to be overvalued. Retailers and institution will surely try to cash in the hype so beware of speculative plays.

With the legalization scenarios, we can expect two outcomes:

1. The Management do not manage to contain costs and improve efficiency, making it growth slow
2. The Management manages to cut cost and boost efficiency, making Tilray grow

There is potential, but risk is very high

**What are the risks?**

Observing statistical data about Tilray's price movements, we can except a 7.72% risk rate. The Stock's return distribution is concentrated around negative numbers. If you want to invest for long time expect a miminum retuern rate of 0.12% and a 44% chancge of getting a daily price movement between -4% and 0%

**Is the company a Buy or a Sell?**

This is hard. It all depend on legalization in the USA, and if it happens, it depends on when it happens. If legalization comes in 5 years, welp, this company is going tits up, but if it come next week, well, you know the drill.

Personally this stock is a Gamble, cause its fate is determined heavily by politics.

Are you a Gamblerer?

t3_ynvpfn|1667753869.0|investing|Lets take a look at cash / savings statistics|"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT

On the average, the typical US Citizen saves 7%. However, COVID19 caused a massive change in behavior, causing savings rates to skyrocket to 20+%. As we come out of COVID19 however, the savings rate has overcorrected and collapsed to under 4% the past few months.

I'm not quite sure what this bodes for investors. But it just seems very odd to me in general. I understand the savings rate coming down from the 20%+ ridiculousness, but 3% is near the absolute lows in our history.

------

I also was looking into savings accounts / MMFs, to try to get a sense of how much cash is sitting out there.

* https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MMMFFAQ027S

* https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-investments-by-fund-category/

We can see the big jump in savings in March 2020, as COVID19 happened. I guess the good news is that as a society, our banks are pretty stuffed still. But I guess I was expecting more savings / more cash to be held as interest rates rose, and the stock market dropped by 20%.

------

I'm not sure if I'm going anywhere with this, aside from it all being somewhat unexpected to me. Given all the tech layoffs and recession talk, I guess I was expecting ""more fear"" in the market. But I'm barely seeing any at all. It could be that some of these statistics are a bit slow to report (the MMFs is quarterly and last reported Q2 2022).

Supply and demand seesaws back and forth.... finance rates go up and down... but more people, more drivers, and demand to replace vehicles that eventually will age out will ultimately push both new and used car sales back up.  It is inevitable.   Supply chain issues will be resolved, manufactures will keep pumping at new inventory,  then when they are sitting on overstuffed lots they will need to offer rebates and financing deals.  So maybe new car sales surge again and for awhile used car demand drops in favor of new....etc... but that assumes buyers can afford new car prices in the long haul even with special rates and rebates.  I believe as the middle class continues to vanish, wages stay flat and new car prices keep soaring... used will still be big business in the long run.  Cars are lasting longer and I wouldn't hesitate to buy my daughters a 8-10 year old low miles used car these days.  Isn't Carvana proving their model works?  People do want to buy this way.  

Tell me why, if Carvana survives they are not perfectly poised to get business growing again.  I don't need it this year or even next year, but if I am putting $10,000 somewhere for the future, why not Carvana?  If it claws back to $100 - I'll cash my million.

https://imgur.com/a/stsZD8y

* $7.8 billion operating earnings, up 20% y/y

* $31.4 billion operating earnings last 4 quarters, up around 25% from the previous 4 quarter.

* Q3 includes a $3.4 billion pre-tax, $2.7 billion after-tax insurance loss from hurricane Ian. https://imgur.com/a/km2eHrW

* $1 billion in buybacks in Q3, all Class A shares. https://imgur.com/a/edgCf8h

* An additional ~$500 million in share repurchases from Oct 1st to Oct 26th based on disclosed share. https://imgur.com/a/SGLOhdk

* Berkshire owns about 20% of Occidental Petroleum (OXY) with warrants to purchase an additional 8%, so they will report as equity method going forward, meaning instead of reporting this as a stock holding, they report is as partial ownership of the company and report a proportional share of the earnings as their own. Since OXY hasn't reported Q3 results yet, they have not included their ~20% of the earnings in this report. They will report on a 1 quarter lag going forward. I estimate OXY's Q3 earnings generated around an extra $500 million in operating earnings this quarter. https://imgur.com/a/nlzPR57

* No major buys or sells apparent from the report.

* Increased cash position to $109 billion

* Berkshire completed the acquisition of Alleghany Corporation (Y) for $11.7 billion in Q4 funded by cash. That wills how up in the annual report.

If all types of investing are covered, including the creative, then if you know any good books or resources that can help a person ethically develop effective investment strategies and come up with creative ideas to make a profit in ""troubled"" or unstable countries and regions, please share them on this thread.

To further clarify my question with details, I'm referring to countries and regions with dictatorial regimes, for example; markets where the government may very well be expected to seize or nationalize companies, especially locally owned companies, that grow too big and too fast; markets with unstable local currencies; countries with high rates of poverty, and so on.

Moreover, as I've indicated, I'm looking for information that helps with the ethical kind of investment endeavors. So, rather than investing in megacorporations that sell weapons and warfare gadgets to the dictatorial regime for quick and huge profits, for example, I'd rather learn about strategies that may bring smaller dividends but contribute to the welfare of the oppressed population.

As for the potential question that may arise from some surprised people, which may be something along the lines of ""why would you choose such risky investments without lucrative ROIs?"", let's just say that perhaps there are people out there who want to do good with their money while trying to increase it, and are willing to take a slightly higher educated risk to help oppressed populations. Moreover, our world is becoming more and more of a global village every day, and the suffering of distant countries is starting to affect us faster and stronger than we've ever seen in human history. The shocking rise of consumer prices all over Europe, Africa, and Asia (perhaps the world?) as a direct result of the war in Ukraine is a clear and recent example of this phenomenon. So, maybe, just maybe, even from a selfish perspective, we may want to pay more attention to alleviating economical problems in distant lands, lest those problems go through unexpected chain reactions that lead to the collapse of our own local economies. And most people will always gravitate toward more secure investments, so we shouldn't make those riskier, more ethical, and perhaps ""benevolent"" investments even less attractive by not having enough information about making them in the smartest, most creative, efficient, and effective ways possible. Finally, the local citizens of those regions, the ones who have some spare resources to invest, may want to know how to deal with their troubled local economies in the most effective ways possible, which balance the aspiration for a profit with the hope of alleviating some of the problems of their fellow citizens and their local economies.

* I'm taking a deeper look at DraftKings. I've written down my pros / cons list + back of napkin long term DraftKings valuation. I'd really appreciate any comments on my assumptions, valuation, and company pros/cons. 
* I like betting on sports. I've been following the US sports betting market since US started legalizing sports betting.
* My back-of-napkin valuation assumes DraftKings will be a $8-16b EV company long term

&amp;#x200B;

**Company / Industry Analysis**

***Pros***

* Strong brand name - customer acquisition costs should be lower
* Online Sports Betting (OSB) + Online Casino Revenue (iGaming) expected to be $60-80b Gross Gaming Revenue (\~$30B OSB + $50B iGaming)
* Long term - Relatively Capital Light Company + 10-20% EBITDA type company

***Cons***

* Ridiculous competition at the moment. Leading to irrational spending on customer acquisition + marketing. This could go on for a while...
* Relative ease for users to switch between platforms will lead to consistent competition between companies. It's possible that the ridiculous competition for customers could lead to low-profit margins long term. What's the long-term value of customers?
* Longer term - I expect regulators to revisit gambling

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Valuation**

* Current Enterprise Value (EV) \~$5b (Peak DraftKings' market capitalisation was \~$28b)
* EV = Market Capitalisation ($5b) + Debt ($1.2b convertible notes) - Cash ($1.3b) = \~$5b
* Last 12 Month Revenue - $1.6b'

&amp;#x200B;

**Long Term Valuation - Top-Down Approach**

* Online Sports Betting (OSB) + Online Casino Revenue (iGaming) Revenue
   * Draftkings management team expects $60-80b GGR (\~$30B OSB + $50B iGaming). Based on NJ spend/adult which, in my view, will be slightly higher than other states
   * *I'll assume $40b GGR at maturity*
* DraftKings Market Share 
   * Assumed 25%. Currently 25% 
   * *$10b Revenue*
* Long Term EBITDA Margins 
   * EBITDA Margins expected to be 10-30%. Australia's Sportsbet has 35% EBITDA margin
   * Assuming 10-20% - see below for a breakdown
      * Variable Costs (20-40%) - Product Fees, Licence Fees, Government Taxes will be fairly static
      * Marketing Costs (30%) - Majority of spend will go to marketing and customer acquisition cost 
      * Product development costs (10%)
      * General Costs of business (10%)
   * *$1-2b EBITDA*
* Using 8x EV/EBITDA
   * *$8-16b EV. $12b midpoint valuation*

&amp;#x200B;

Downside  worst-case scenario - key risks

* OSB / iGaming TAM is much lower than expected
* Irrational marketing spend persists long term and eats into industry profit margins. In the short term, this leads to equity raising and company dilutions
* DraftKing’s product is terrible and users turn to other products"|0.44|0.0|0.0|0.0

If they exist, the rate is very far above shorter mortgage terms. In Canada, 10 year fixed mortgage rates have doubled (from 2.99% to 5.94%) from the lows in 2020 to the current rate. 30 year rates are almost unheard of. [The only 25 year fixed mortgage is offered by the Royal Bank of Canada and is currently quoted at 9.75%.](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-mortgage-rates/25-year/fixed)

Because of a long term downtrend in interest rates between the early 1980s to 2021, personal finance subreddits like r/PersonalFinanceCanada as well as people in real life have recommended for decades that borrowers choose variable mortgages. Those mortgages have rates that fluctuate based on the [Bank of Canada's key interest rate, which has gone up repeatedly in 2022.](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/key-interest-rate/) Mortgage contracts require that all borrowers must pay all of the interest due even if the principal is not being paid down at all. When interest rates rise substantially, the amount that a borrower is paying may not be sufficient to pay off the interest and as such, payments go up, sometimes by [$2000 a month](https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2022/10/26/surrey-man-home-high-rates/). Unless a borrower was very frugal and has very high income, this is a financial disaster.

Now, we know that inflation is very high in a lot of countries (except China and Japan, in bot cases due to severe population aging and for China, draconian lockdowns severely curtailed economic activity). [Despite wages going up nominally, they have not kept pace with inflation.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221104/dq221104a-eng.htm) In 2008, it took only a small segment of borrowers defaulting to bring down the housing market in the US, and in 2023, it will also only take a very small number of borrowers defaulting in the [fastest rate hiking cycle in nearly 50 years](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/comparing-the-speed-of-u-s-interest-rate-hikes/) to bring down multiple housing markets and clog up the court systems with personal bankruptcy cases."|0.91|571.0|0.0|571.0

What changed to make interest rates almost the sole determinant of the market's trajectory?|"I would like to understand the relation between the stock market and interest rates. It used to be that the stock market was independent of interest rates. When rates increased, the market could rise or fall. When rates fell, the market could rise or fall. Since 2008, however, it seems that the only thing that determines the direction of the market is the trajectory of interest rates. If rates fall, stocks rise. If rates rise, stocks fall. Stocks *cannot* rise if rates are rising. And they *cannot* fall if rates are falling.

Why?

Why can't the market ignore the Fed and trade normally? Why don't we have more normal trading days where 30% of stocks rise, 30% of stocks fall, and 40% of stocks don't move?

Can we return to a time where stocks can rise in a rising rates environment? Can we return to a time when stocks can fall in a falling rates environment?

I'm not disappointed that stocks are down YTD. I think most stocks are still overvalued.

But aren't individual stocks supposed to be traded based on investor sentiment and the fundamentals of the underlying business, not just interest rates?

Single-B rated Carnival used 12 of it's vessels, with a total appraised value of more than $8 billion, as collateral backing the debt. ""Without the ships, I don’t believe that they would have access to  capital at a price they would have been comfortable with,” John McClain,  high yield portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment  Management, told the *FT*.

""Indeed, it’s been an expensive proposition for companies looking to  finance themselves in the speculative-grade bond market. Borrowers that  have come to market this month have paid an average all-in yield of  12.25%, data from LCD showed yesterday, the highest since 2009. All but  one of the eight deals that have priced in October featured double digit  yields, a 87.5% share, compared to 31.4% during the third quarter and  just 1.4% in the first three months of the year.""

Private equity companies, large suppliers of debt financing during normal times, have begun funding buyouts as large as $2 billion through strict equity deals with no debt financing in place. Richard Farley, partner at law firm Kramer, Levin, Neftalis and Frankel, told Bloomberg that ""They don’t want to be locked into very expensive debt if they think they  are going to have access to the debt market at more attractive rates in  a short period of time.”

""What if markets don’t cooperate? Private equity-sponsored firms account  for roughly 80% of the single-B-minus rated cohort of speculative grade  credits, Moody’s analyst Christina Padgett found back in May. That  ratings category represents a quarter of the broader sub-investment  grade universe, double the pre-crisis population. More broadly, 60% of  junk bonds and leveraged loans are rated single-B and below, compared to  about 40% during the previous buyout boom’s peak in 2006."")-*Almost Daily Grant's 10/20*

While private equity can have positive impacts on firms profitability, growth, and capital expenditures during normal economic times, can they exacerbate market downturns? Given that PE sponsored firms account for nearly a quarter of all sub-investment grade credits, had deal-making during the time of rock-bottom interest rates gotten sloppy? 

A quote from a paper titled ""Private Equity and Financial Fragility During the Crisis"" written by professors at Northwestern finds the following, "" Looking across multiple market cycles and geographies, Axelson and co-authors (2013) explore one of the above considerations. They show that the use of leverage in buyouts has little to do with the underlying characteristics of the companies themselves, but rather are driven by changes in credit conditions in the broader economy. These periods of high leverage are associated with higher transaction prices and lower subsequent returns, suggesting that private equity investors over-leverage and overpay when access to credit is readily available. Moreover, the increased level of activity during booms may translate into an inability to effectively monitor and fund their portfolio firms during economic downturns, as witnessed by the lower relative rates of productivity growth by private equity-backed firms during these periods (Davis, et al, 2014)."""|0.79|10.0|0.0|10.0

# Risk Analysis - Statistical Analysis

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 2002 to 2022, we have the following data:

|Expected Minimum Return|0.16%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|0.26%|
|Standard Deviation|5.07%|

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 1st December 2021 to Today, 5th November 2022, we have the following data: 4739

|Expected Minimum Return|1.09%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|1.72%|
|Standard Deviation|13.11%|

&amp;#x200B;

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data. 

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

# Final Comment

With its current amount of Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

Just coming on to share the mind-bogglingly low valuation of Paramount (PARA). Consider the following:

1.) Paramount possesses the fastest growing streaming offering in the market, Paramount+.

2.) Paramount owns CBS and has the rights to broadcast most NFL games as well as Premier League Soccer.

3.) Paramount Pictures has had a wildly successful year, including the release of Top Gun Maverick, the 5th highest grossing film of all time.

Despite this, PARA shares are trading at an embarrassingly low valuation:

1.) Price/earnings multiple of less than 8.

2.) Approximately one third price/sales.

3.) Less than half of book value.

Paramount is definitely a company in transition, but this valuation dislocation is borderline criminal. On top of this beautiful stock sundae, you get more than 6% in dividend yield just to hold the shares while you wait for the price to normalize, and the short interest is just under 15%.

Just looking for a gut check, as this is a super important decision for me…..

I have all our retirement accounts at Vanguard. Love the product, hate the service. I use a passive-income, Bogle approach. No active trading, index funds, etc. I have an investment advisor who looks over my shoulder, who I like and trust.

The advisor is suggesting we move the Vanguard accounts to National Financial Services, as a custodian. Then his firm - only with approval - would be able to conduct some transactions which would greatly help my wife and I. And most importantly, we could get away from the Vanguard service in favor of NFS which is supposed to be much better.

I would pay my advisor a slightly higher annual fee, which I am fine with. He would handle the paperwork to move the account to NFS and I’d access that through his portal on Investor 360. For the extra $ I then have more help from my advisor, better service through NFS/Fidelity, and everything is easier to manage.

Does that make sense? What am I missing? Do I have a blind spot here? All feedback is welcome!"|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0

t3_ylhzbb|1667517076.0|investing|Create a custom index to mimic a benchmark|"Has anyone created their own index to mimic a benchmark like the s&amp;p 500 by actually buying the individual securities or fractional shares?  If so what was your approach? Did you use software?  As opposed to hiring a manager, I'd like to do this and harvest tax losses where possible.

See below for my understanding of tax loss harvesting for those who want context.

*Assuming you have enough assets, you can create your own index to mimic the S&amp;P 500. If you hire an advisor to do this to track the S&amp;P 500, generally the advisor will buy 300 of the S&amp;P 500 stocks. They will use software to help select the 300 stocks such that the selection has the same characteristics as the S&amp;P 500 (e.g. volatility, sector weights, etc). Then either using predefined triggers (sets points in time, losses, etc) they will choose to sell some of the losers and purchase highly correlated but different stocks to replace the sellers in the portfolio. For example, they might sell Coke and buy Pepsi, sell Chevron and buy Exxon, etc. Advisors may charge 50 basis points for this and end up using companies like Aperio, Parametric, etc that have portfolio optimization software.*

*Another option would be to use ETFs vs individual stocks. You would not be able to harvest quite as much but still, a worthwhile solution especially if you don't want to manage individual stocks or have more limited assets.*

Wealthfront I think offers their US Direct Indexing program but it seems you don't have much customization in terms of what stocks are picked and I don't know how they actually decide what and when to harvest.

Ultimately I think the value added from tax loss harvesting isn't worth 30 or more basis points but maybe I'm wrong. Unless you keep adding to the portfolio every year after a few years you might not have much to harvest and then what are you paying for if you just want to own an index fund. I suppose they can help you rebalance when your index exceeds what tracking error you want (meaning it diverges too far from your benchmark index) but then that has tax consequences.

t3_yl13u3|1667477475.0|investing|Why is the derivates market “flipped” in oil (and maybe other commodities)?|"I work in oil and trade swaps and futures for hedging purposes only so my theoretical knowledge of commodities/oil markets is not on a professional level, however I do like to read about equity markets a lot.

What really confuses me is that how swaps/futures prices, or what we call “market structure” in oil is basically opposite to equities. In equities, if the futures prices of sp500 are in green and the curve is positive (increasing), that’s a bullish sign. In oil that’s known as a “contango” and a very bearish sign.

And it works other way around, futures in red for equities is bearish, and in oil, known as “backwardation” is a bullish sign. 

For example, during covid crisis when the oil market was obliterated the market was in a massive contango, today (since late last year) there has been a crazy backwardation, especially on certain products like gasoline.

I’ve spoken to a bunch of professionals about this and never got quite a satisfactory answer. I kinda sorta make sense of backwardation, if there is a massive shortage of oil and everyone is desperate to buy it now, I as a producer might need to give a discount to my clients to buy next month instead of this month. That is the best I could come up with. But what about contango? If oil is trending downwards, and it’s not expected to have a high demand in coming months, why would anyone buy it for a higher price in the future?"|0.79|35.0|0.0|35.0

I am looking for an article I read about a month ago but that could have been quite a bit older than that.

It was a study that presented 3 cases to the respondents, asking them which scenario seemed the most beneficial for DCA investment:

The first one was DCA through a steadily rising market with low VOL

Second one was DCA through a rising market with higher VOL

Last one was DCA through a market going down for 2/3 of the period, then going up to catch up.

Obviously last one was the most favourable one and the study made the point that most respondents wouldn't instinctively choose that one because they do not like to see red in their portfolio.

Thinking with common sense, it would seem that only issuing new shares or bonds would amount to allocation of capital in a way that changes what is being produced. Surely trading helps to determine how investors value the company, and maybe that helps with pricing new share issues or loans to the company, but is there anything else? Or is the aftermarket of a share just a place to park one's money for the investor's benefit in the form of dividends and growth in the share value?

/u/Kaldabra contributed probably the most important explanation about the benefit of stockexchanges/aftermarket trading to the whole economy, or perhaps even the purpose of its existence: very simply put, it enables big index/mutual funds to have enough liquidity to buy ""mature"" shares from private equity, which in turn will then have enough liquidity to buy shares of ”rising” companies from venture capital funds, which have obviously done some of the most crucial grass roots capital allocation for production, and probably wouldn’t have, if there was not enough liquidity and thus no one to buy those appreciated investments.

# Final Comment

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash &amp; cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

This gives the market a lot of liquidity which attracts speculative traders. I am researching the global oil supply chain and trying to find how fast does the change in future contracts affect the consumer.

Brent is used as a benchmark for the price of oil since its extracted from the North sea. This is because it can be simply be loaded on a tanker and shipped to any country to the world (which has a port ofcourse). This makes it more reliable for tracking global economic activity compared to other crude producing contracts such as WTI which is land locked in Cushing, Oklahoma USA and is constrained by land pipelines.

Brent ice futures has more than 1,300 large crude tankers or \~2.2 billion barrels of capacity actively operating globally.  Vessels in-transit, loading, ballasting and vessels unavailable, the IEA estimated that at the end of April, 120-125 million barrels of crude were stored at sea, and a further 130-155 million barrels were available for floating storage. 

Future contracts expire on 3 days before the 25th of every month (or close to that date if the 25th is not a working day).  

WTI/Brent futures contract is a deliverable contract based on Exchange for Physical (EFP) delivery + the NYMEX/ICE Index  (this is optional but since we are talking about supply chains we are going to assume that the delivery will be fulfilled). Also I am not taking into account factors that can impact the supply and demand such as contango or backwardation. I just want to know if crude futures are trading at for example 90$ TODAY, how does that affect the price if oil at the pump TODAY. How long does it take for the trading price to affect the real world price.

Since the supply chain has lead times related to downstream and the upstream (extracting, refining, storing, transportation, consuming) I want to know how do futures prices affect the oil before its been it enters the supply chain, hence the name ""future contracts""

If anyone has experience working on oil rigs or is involved in any stage of the supply chain please leave your knowledge here. THX

a couple months ago I was at a -53% return on all of my investments, which is kind of hilarious to me. I love watching videos about longterm trading that say things like ""If you invest $500/month for the next 40 years, you'll hit $1mil! Assuming you're making at least +20% each year"".

In my mind, that's a HUGE assumption.

Anyway, I'm still putting in money, and I've been focusing on the safer bets lately. Slowly inching lower and lower, but it's going to be a LONG crawl out of the hole I'm in.

Anyone else as terrible of an investor as I am?"|0.82|686.0|0.0|686.0

I'm 28 yo non-US investor here and I found JEPI/Q more attractive and lucrative than our local investments, even with a 25% dividend tax!

I recently sold a property and have $220,000 disposable cash right now and planning a lump sum of 30% of it to JEPI/JEPQ and DCA the rest for 2-3 years.

I aim to generate extra monthly income for myself as a freelancer since my income is cyclical - I have some great months and some ghost months. The dividends are there to supply my ghost months but will reinvest to VOO/SCHD when it's not. Don't worry about my emergency fund since I have 1 year's worth of it.

My main question is, how sustainable are the dividends on JEPI/Q like will there be months that pay low dividends?

Is it also okay to go all-in in JEPI/Q and then diversify along the way? 100% of my portfolio right now is in S&amp;P500 but I have to wait decades to maximize its return and start withdrawing. I need something that supplies my monthly income and I think JEPI/Q fits my goal so far."|0.8|18.0|0.0|18.0

 San Francisco Fed Bank’s President Mary Daly emphasized the central bank’s precarious position, noting that it is at risk of either overtightening, which would cause a severe recession, or under-tightening, which would increase inflation.

# Final Comment

As we can see, AMD is a good and stable company, with huge potential from its fundamentals. We can expect at least 1.91% return in perpetual from this stock if we want to hold it forever, with a probability to see swings between +20% and -20%.

AMD had a high beta compare to the sector and the industry, this makes it riskier and potentially very lucrative than the average peers.

Its P/E is above the industry and the market itself, probably a little bit overvalued.

High profits margin and ROA suggest us a potential growth, same for ROE and ROIC. DuPont Analysis shows a positive 62.87%.

Financial indicators point out the fact that AMD's financials are stable and not in danger in any front in the short and mid run.

We shall take in mind that 2020 and 2021 were outliers years, and due to the lockdown the company had huge profits came with speculative bubble of those two years. The speculative bubble pushed for a positive trend on the company, inflating its price well over its fundamental value. We shall expect to see a regression towards the mean growth range and the price to stabilize to its fundamental, discounting off the hype and trend.

If this company paid dividends, it would have a higher evaluation.

Its **current** fair value is

|Price|Factors considered|
|:-|:-|
|$51.28|WACC + Earning Based growth rate|
|$47.80|WACC + Earning Based growth rate + interest rates of 4%|
|$54.94|WACC + Earning Based growth rate + ROA based growth|
|$50|WACC + Earning Based growth + ROA based growth + interest rates of 4%|
|$86|RRR + Earning Based growth|
|$58.90|RRR + Earning Based growth  + Interest rates of 4%|
|**$58.15**|**Average of all the factors considered**|

&amp;#x200B;

Reminder that this is based on the balance sheet of 2021 business year's end, in fact, growth in revenue is already over expectation, as well as costs one, but net income not yet, still under 1B missing until now, expecting a **net income of 4B EOY**

The company is a Long Hold and have high probability to pay dividends in the future, but as for now, it is **overvalued by 10-15%** due to last year trend. Good buying positions shall be around 50-55 dollars

Can someone ELI5: 
But as central banks such as the Federal Reserve engage in one of the biggest interest-rate-hike campaigns in decades, demand for U.S. government bonds already in circulation has fallen in part because most of that debt carries lower interest rates than the bonds being issued today. That could mean a glut of cheap, low-yielding debt with few buyers.
There’s been no emergency thus far, but the market for Treasury bonds is drawing increased attention out of concern that as liquidity dries up across the globe, there may at some point not be enough buyers of debt issued by the U.S. government. 
...
“If we were to have a buyers’ strike, or a failed series of Treasury auctions, 


I don't understand this. The first part, is this like the price of bonds in the secondary going to zero? (I'm [probably] exaggerating because the yield would then be infinite.) And (second part) if rates are going up, how would you have failed treasury auctions?  I would think that people (or countries, if we're talking on the massive scale) would be buying these, since these are new issues (as opposed to buying on the secondary market ones issued a year ago ).

Like nothing happened, no recession whatsoever, S&amp;Ps performance didnt change, just people selling out that ETF. Normally, that would drive the price of the stock down, right?

I’m in my late 30’s with virtually nothing put away except a few grand I’ve put in an IRA this year. Finally earning enough and have enough months bills in savings  to try and play catch up.

I can realistically put 10-15k a year into an IRA or Roth for the foreseeable future and in another 9 months one of my employers will have a 401k available. That job is less than a third of my income so that 401k is a great benefit but probably won’t be a huge amount.

I’m leaning towards being super safe with about 10k a year and whatever I can put away on top of that being a bit more aggressive with?

Does that seem reasonable? Should I be treating every dollar conservatively because I can’t afford any losses? Or should I be more aggressive because what’s the point of having some retirement money but not nearly enough when I’m in my mid 70s and I can’t do this work anymore?

Obviously there’s no exact answer but I’d really appreciate some feedback.

Also my idea of aggressive here is high dividend REITs, maybe JEPI, or something like QQQ that’s so beaten up right now I feel like there has to be long term value. Maybe some in companies like Intel which I did get some shares of when it was at 26 so yay me on stashing some there that’s up 15% and will pay a dividend. I’m not talking about trying to make up for lost time gambling thousands on options or penny stocks. My idea of conservative is put it all in VTI maybe some in SCHD.

t3_ygv9zg|1667078794.0|investing|How money are (actually) created?|"First of all, I m not talking about bank multiplication, because i don’t consider it “actual” money creation - but rather balance creation. In no way people could ever withdraw more money than they put in banks, so banks can’t multiply “real” money (currency or such money that can be used to buy treasuries - details below). 

There used to be gold standard that, that would suggest amount of money in circulation should match us gold reserves, which at 1971 were around $100 bil (7.5 kton gold *$35/oz). 

Nowadays, only in currency, there is about 2.3T usd. As mentioned above, bank multiplication can’t have anything to do with it because 2.3T can simultaneously be withdrawn and at hands of population. 

One thing comes to mind is US treasury and treasury bonds. 

Correct me if i m wrong, but i believe treasury accounts exist outside banking system, in a way that money in a possession of us treasury can not be counted as bank “assets” and therefore can not be multiplied. Money in a possession of treasury effectively dont exist from perspective of the rest of economy or banking system, until reintroduced when government pays to public sector in one way or another. 

When treasury needs money, they issue bonds that can be purchased with money but since that money effectively disappearing from banking system, all previously multiplied money are disappearing too and treasury is purchased with “real” money. 

Thus, we can draw parallel between treasuries and real money (money actually created by government, not balances multiplied by banks). 

This appears to be the reason why fed is very quick to temporary exchange treasuries to money, or money for treasuries - because in doing do fed neither create nor destroys real money. 

Fair enough, but there is still no answer how such money are being created. 

One way is perhaps through treasury bonds as described above: 

Population had $100bil, us treasury issues $100bil worth of bonds that population buys. Next, government transacts with population and buys $100bil worth of services, so population now has $100bil again and $100bil worth of treasuries. After that us treasury can issue another $100bil worth of bonds, and repeat the cycle, so in the end population will hold 30T worth of bonds (current us debt) and $100bil of original money. 

Some of those treasuries were purchased by fed, and as we know their balance sheet is now almost $9T, which means population holds 21T worth of treasuries and 9.1T worth of real-ish money (that fed can pull back by selling assets) 

Btw, i think when fed buys non-treasury assets is a only time fed actually creates “real” money (and not money mirrored by treasuries). 

Then there is interest that government has to pay, and taxes government collects. 

Is it really something like 

Money supply = $100bil of “original gold-backed money” + treasuries issued + interest paid on treasuries + government spendings (inc interest) - taxes collected + whatever fed is doing with non-treasury assets

? 

Or am i way far off? Anyone knows exactly how it works? 

And how was it working before abandoning gold standard? Since technically nobody stops treasury to do all of it while gold standard exists (as long as money is us debt, obligations + gold = money supply formula would hold)"|0.24|0.0|0.0|0.0

* Tenants pay me $2.5k/month
* Mortgage is 3.3% interest and is $2.5k/month (escrow included)
* Mortgage Left = $384,933.98

Are financial advisors worth it?|"There's a chance that my small business is getting bought out..which means I may get an opportunity to finally have a decent amount of cash on hand. What would you do with a lump sum of money right now? 

I plan on doing the following:
-Paying off all credit cards and student loans
-Putting a chunk into mutual funds/low risk investments
-Putting some into a high interest savings account
-putting some into etfs 
-remodeling my bathroom 
-possibly buying a rental property (maybe waiting until home prices continue to decrease) 
-throw some into crypto, specially bitcoin and ETH? 

Are financial advisors really worth it if you plan on playing it somewhat safe?

EDIT: So I've gotten some follow-up questions... 
-This would potentially be a 400k payout (pre capital-gains tax)
-This is my side business. I have a fulltime job that has great benefits and compensation. 
-I would immediately do the following: pay off all debts, max out my benefits with fulltime job (401k, HSA, Employee Stock purchase program)

My follow up question to the rest of the forum: Are Financial Advisors primarily meant to help you out with taxes? Or they really really worth it if want to grow your net worth?

It is quite a difficult question to contemplate. Do you lower your taxable income now and let it grow or use post tax dollars hoping the tax rate will be lower in retirement?

It seems like it would be better to go traditional and use your pre-tax dollars to invest. By the time you retire, you won't have the same bills you have now, ""hopefully"". By that time, you should have your house paid off, vehicles paid off. Also, your income should be lower. You won't make the same income in retirement since you won't have a job. I mean if we needed the same money in retirement, we would never be able to retire, right? Anyway, your income bracket should change (hopefully be lower).

First, let's hope we all make to retirement ;) But for example, let's say I am married and we make $120K jointly and are in the 22% bracket. We retire tomorrow with house paid off and no bills besides the utilities so we dont need the same income to live as before. Lets say we need to $60K to $80K to take some trips, food, pay utilities, car repair, etc. We are now in the 12% bracket.

* Pre-tax, you are not paying a 22% tax on the money, letting 100% of that money grow until retirement. When we take it out, we are paying 12% on the money but 100% of our money has been growing since the beginning.
* Post-tax, it's almost like a front-end loaded investment. You are paying 22% on the money up front. So while that money is growing at the same rate, you lost some compounding power at the very beginning.

What do you guys think? Every situation is different but it seems traditional makes more sense. Am I missing something?"|0.84|20.0|0.0|20.0

The first 4 minutes of the video are enough for you to understand what happened to a lot of people that were investing in the market recently, including the big investors. Including most of us.

In summary: (I am quoting him)

*It is easy to make money in the market, specially when market goes up. 8 out of 10 years, market goes up*. *You can make good money not having risk control in these 8 years, but in the other 2 years not having the risk control will cause serious damage.*

Asymmetry is the word.  ***You do better in the good years than you do badly in the bad years.***

And Risk Control means:  ***limiting portfolio leverage*** (low int. rate helped a lot of us to leverage in excess our portfolios), ***risk of companies you invest in*** (ARK portfolio companies comes to my mind), ***risk of instruments you invest in*** (SPACs and Cryptos comes to my mind)

It is not too late guys, let's take back the control of our future. Consistency and risk control. ;-)

This can be a very (very) lengthy post, but I plan to keep this concise, and will attempt to illustrate my view above using data from various sources. I won't spend too much writing providing explanation or definitions of these series and limit observations and opinions in order to minimalism this post.

Let's start by looking at [actual value of US stocks (market capitalization) relative to the estimated value of the market capitalization](https://imgur.com/a/6DGqsEZ) using their bonds as an input. Note: In almost all periods, US stocks are undervalued relative to corporate debt. (sources: Federal Reserve)

Second, if the pinnacle of stock overvaluation relative to its debt was 1999-2000 pre-TMT bubble, [we are back to that period](https://imgur.com/a/rEDDEjN); here is a [histogram graph](https://imgur.com/a/vLAtZxL) as well. (source: Federal Reserve). I do understand that spreads are not the same as they were in this time period, however, the return to these levels are more a function of the recent bond route in investment grade corporate bonds.

Third, the Federal Reserves actions, specifically with rate raises, has [triggered a value shift from US stocks to US corporate bonds](https://imgur.com/a/Td7qDCJ); this is nothing new. (source: Federal Reserve)

How might this manifest? Here are a few thoughts:

* Assuming investment grade corporate debt recoups 50% of its current losses from its peak, a re-calibration of historical performance between stocks and corporate bonds pins S&amp;P 500 around 3,225.
* Assuming investment grade corporate debt is stable at these levels, ie. yields are tightly range bound and volatility subsides, a re-calibration of historical performance between stocks and corporate bonds pins S&amp;P 500 around 2,800.
* Assuming US Stocks overshoot to the downside (similar to 2003) much like the did to the upside post-COVID and like they did in 2000, and assuming US corporate debt returns to the all-time high levels seen in late 2021, the S&amp;P 500 would trade around 2,500.
* It would be expected that further downside in US corporate debt (investment grade bonds) would see a rapidly declining S&amp;P 500.

The natural disaster took its toll on marijuana operators last month, including Curaleaf, which had to close roughly 70% of Florida-based stores for a few days.

On the bright side, New Jersey is expected to be a ""key driver"" in the third quarter, the analyst said.

""We estimate the company had a 30% share of the net wholesale market in the state and had two rec stores opened throughout 3Q,"" he added.

In terms of the fourth quarter and 2023 outlook, Zuanic projects that the company would benefit the most from the closing of the acquisition of Tryke Companies (dba as Reef Dispensaries), a privately held, vertically integrated MSO. With the close of the transaction, Curaleaf's national footprint has reached 29 cultivation sites and 144 dispensaries nationwide.

According to Zuanic, other factors expected to fuel Curaleaf's growth are additional store openings and seasonality, to name a few.

&gt;Fed officials watch Friday’s data points closely for clues about where costs are headed, particularly with a tight labor market in which there are 1.7 jobs per every available worker, according to recent BLS data.

Consumer spending still (unsustainably) strong

&gt;The BEA also reported that personal income increased 0.4% in September, one-tenth of a percentage point above the estimate. Spending as gauged through personal consumption expenditures increased 0.6%, more than the 0.4% estimate.

&gt;However, when adjusted for inflation, spending rose just 0.3%. Disposable personal income, or what is left after taxes and other charges, rose 0.4% on the month but was flat on an inflation-adjusted basis.

Federal Reserve officials will maintain their resolutely hawkish stance next week, laying the groundwork for interest rates reaching 5% by March 2023, moves that seem likely to lead to a US and global recession, economists surveyed by Bloomberg said.

The Federal Open Market Committee will raise rates by 75 basis points for a fourth consecutive meeting when policymakers announce their decision at 2 p.m. in Washington Wednesday, the survey found.

Rates are projected in the survey to rise another half point in December, then by quarter points the following two meetings. Fed forecasts released at the September meeting showed rates reaching 4.4% this year and 4.6% next year, before cuts in 2024. 

Rates Heading to 5% in 2023
Economists see 75 basis-point hike, then downshifting.

Economists see the Fed as determined not to pivot too soon as it fights against an inflation rate at a 40-year high. The shift to a higher peak rate would reflect consumer-price growth, excluding food and energy, that came in hotter than expected for the past two months. The survey of 40 economists was conducted Oct. 21-26.

“Inflation pressures remain intense and the Fed is set to hike by 75 basis points in November,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Groep NV, said in a survey response “We are currently forecasting a more muted 50 basis-point hike in December given a weakening economic and market backdrop,” but the risks are skewed toward a fifth 75 basis-point hike, he said.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank is strongly committed to restoring price stability and he’s repeatedly invoked his predecessor, Paul Volcker, who boosted rates to unprecedented levels to counter inflation in the early 1980s. Powell has warned the process will be painful, because the goal is to engineer below-trend growth to reduce price pressures and unemployment will rise as a result.

Three-Quarters of Economists Expect a US Recession
Survey shows a new consensus for a downturn in next 24 months

Economists were asked if US would have a recession in the next 24 months. Hard landing is defined as zero or negative growth for a time but not an officially declared recession.

Powell and his colleagues have not given up hope that they can pull off a soft landing for the economy. But for the first time in the pre-FOMC meeting surveys, a majority of the economists -- three-quarters -- see a recession as likely over the next two years, and most of the rest see a hard landing with a period of zero or negative growth ahead.

What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“I think the most important thing to watch for is how Powell  communicates the potential downshift in the pace of rate hikes. He will want to avoid giving the impression that a pivot is imminent, especially not when core inflation is clearly still going strong. He would be preparing for the markets for a 50 basis-point hike in December but which will also be accompanied with a dot plot, which shows 5% terminal rate.”

-- Anna Wong, chief US economist

The economists see the Fed as potentially overtightening: The median economist would set a peak target rate at 4.75%, and 75% of the economists said there’s a greater risk that the central bank will raise rates too much and cause unnecessary pain as opposed to not raising enough and failing to contain inflation.

“Monetary-policy lags are still underestimated,” said Thomas Costerg, senior US economist at Pictet Wealth Management.  “The full effect of current tightening may not be felt until mid-2023. By then, it could be too late. The risk of a policy mistake is high.”

There could be economic spillover too to global markets, as two-thirds expect a global recession in the next two years.

It's pretty amazing to me how we can get information so wrong even when its publicly available. I'll just go over some common narratives that just miss the point and then I'll go over the principle of what is going on with Meta's stock price.

False Narratives

1. **Meta stock is declining because people are not using Meta's Family of Apps.** There are more people using Meta's products more than ever. You can read their earnings. Their daily and monthly active users are up. I think there was one quarter in which Meta reported lower DAU/MAU and suddenly there's a narrative that everyone is fleeing their products. This is just not rooted in reality
2. **Meta can't compete with TikTok.** This narrative I can't really say isn't rooted in reality but from their earnings, their Reels views is up 50%. It could be the case that Meta can't compete with TikTok but it's unclear to me given the evidence that this the case. At first glance, it seems like Reels growth of 50% is pretty good.

&amp;#x200B;

There are just a couple off the top of my head that is a bit frustrating because it feels lazy to just circle jerk a narrative without even considering the facts.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole point of the stock drop is because Mark and Meta's leadership team has decided to invest 10 billion dollars a year in developing the Metaverse. The core business is surprisingly strong.

&amp;#x200B;

There are 2 sides to this position that Mark has put Meta in.

1. You believe immersive technology with AR/VR is the future of computing and this investment in the Metaverse creates a technological moat for Meta.
2. You don't believe such immersive technology is possible within the next 5-10 years and the investment into the Metaverse is a waste.

Anyone who tells you with certainty that (1) or (2) is true is presenting you with an opinion. The point is that no one really knows.

&amp;#x200B;

The stock price is reflective that more capital has position (2) where they don't believe the investment is worth it. It certainly can be the case that technology has its limits and this kind of technological capability just isn't possible to get good enough where it gets mainstream adoption within the next 5-10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it could also be the case that Mark is right. The future is AR/VR and the 'Metaverse' is successful. If certainly can be the case that the technology can get good enough where it gets mainstream adoption.

I can't tell you what's going to happen in the future but right now it seems like most people are betting against Meta but that doesn't mean Meta is going to fail. However, if people do bet on Mark and Meta and they turn out to be right, then they have much bigger upside because the stock price is lowering because it seems like most people do not believe in Meta's vision.

I'm not sure I believe in Meta's vision but just because I don't does not automatically mean its destined to fail. **The real conversion to have about Meta is whether we believe that such immersive AR/VR technologies can improve to a point where mainstream will adopt it within the next 5-10 years.**"|0.6|10.0|0.0|10.0
t3_yfi7zb|1666944833.0|investing|Market overreactions to recent news|"The market has, in my view, been severely overreacting the past month. For comparison, on the day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, February 21, fears of delisting/ADRs being voided/bankruptcy from sanctions (take your pick) made many Russian stocks plunge 15-20% that day. We’ve now seen lots of the strongest American companies fall a greater amount than that - Amazon having a -25% crash yesterday for example, and wiping out half a decade of growth.

The thing is, Amazon isn’t at risk of delisting or its shares being voided. Nor is there any chance Amazon goes bankrupt in the next quarter. So why are markets reacting as though it will? A bad ER could justify a -5-10% fall, but Amazon was already down as much during the day’s trading session on fears of the ER being bad. Add to that another -20% crash after hours and it all seems a bit excessive.

Is it just the case that the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent?"|0.2|0.0|0.0|0.0

# Introduction

## Background

Intel used to be a giant in the microchip and semiconductor sector, but recently it found itself eclipsed by its competitor in matters of quality, strategic development and public perception. Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.

## Purpose

The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).

All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

## Hypothesis

* INTC is not a dying company
* INTC downtrend is following the sector and the market movement
* INTC is a cyclical business, and we are in a down cycle
* INTC investments will boost its revenues in the next five years
* USA government will not allow one of its pivotal and strategic company to fail
* INTC will face more stress as AMD is eating market share
* INTC’s new products are the top-notch of the sector

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

## Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|**Levered Beta**|**0.71**|
|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.54**|
|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|
|**WACC**|**6.45%**|
|Hurdle Rate|11.64%|
|**ROE**|**25.50%**|
|**EPS**|**4.66**|
|**P/E**|**5.65**|
|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|
|Corp Tax|8.46%|
|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|
|Analyst growth estimate|\-0.16%|
|Next 5y Analysts growth|12.80%|
|Intel’s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|
|Outstanding Shares|4,106,000,000|
|Earnings distributed|28.41%|
|Earnings retained|71.59%|

# Macro Economic Data

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return|9.40%|
|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|
|Risk Premium|5.19%|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|
|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|
|Current Market P/E|18.58|

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of 30 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.45% and its Growth Rate of 18.26% to determine a fair value of **$23.57** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|18.26|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$97.53**

&amp;#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|18.26%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,106,000,000|

## Dividend Discount Model

The dividend discount model (DDM) is a quantitative method used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value.

The model gives a negative number when companies have a lower rate of return compared to the dividend growth rate. This may happen when a company continues to pay dividends even if it is incurring a loss or relatively lower earnings, as per Intel Case. This makes this model not good to be used alone when evaluating a business.

Knowing this, the model is still used here, mainly because the final price tag is determined by the average of all the methods. This choice is made by the necessity of conservative estimates and cautious predictions. The discounted rating used here is the CAPM of 7.01%.

The model gives the following result:

|Fair Value, taking in count a perpetual growth rate. Here we used the company growth rate of 18.26% and not the average growth rate of the dividends. This is due to the fact that the price given by the dividend growth is considered to be unrealistic for the next five years.|$-15.36|
|:-|:-|
|Fair Value assuming a zero growth in the dividends' growth. This price is not used to determine the final value due to the fact that the company has historically paid dividends with constant growth, and it is predicted to not stop this trend.|$24.62|

&amp;#x200B;

## Total Payout Model

It is a variation of the DDF that takes in count shares repurchases. With 5.64 Billion paid in dividend in 2021, discount rate of 7.01% (CAPM) and growth rate of 18.26%, this model gives us a price tag of -**$12.22**

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$23.57|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$97.53|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|$56.67|
|Dividend Discount Model|$-15.36|
|Total Payout Model|\-$12.22|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$30.04**|

&amp;#x200B;

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot.

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&amp;C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&amp;E

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $30.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

One where appearance matters much more than actual substance. You might even say this is reflective of society at large, perhaps even one where Zuckerberg helped mold. The issue lies in the fact that we live in a world where simply changing your name to include a buzzy new catchword such as crypto, NFT, or Metaverse can increase your company's valuation multiple times without changing much else.

If you have a different quantitative leading indicator that you prefer, I'd be interested in trying it out.

**I use the following predictors / valuation measures:**

*Stocks:*

Jesse Livermore's Average Investor Equity Allocation (AIEA) has the best performance that I’ve found.

Briefly, AIEA is (Stocks Owned) / (Stocks + Bonds + Cash Owned) by the entire market. It can be thought of as a slow-moving fear/greed indicator, where higher values are greedy and lower values are fearful.

AIEA is discussed here: [https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/), and the raw data is available here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis).

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.86 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 6.2 +/- 2.5%.

*Bonds:*

The mechanism used for the model is that the bonds held are traded each month for new bonds at the new interest rate. This takes into account the effect of changing interest rates on the value of bonds held, but not taxes or fees. Coupon payments are reinvested. The given interest rate for the current ten year bond is a good (though not perfect) predictor for what the ten year return will be. The data comes from [http://www.econ.yale.edu/\~shiller/data/ie\_data.xls](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls)

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.88 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 3.68 +/- 2.0%

*Commodities:*

The best predictor that I found was GSCI/GDP. GSCI is S&amp;P’s commodity index, with records back to 1970 here: [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci). GDP is the U.S. gross domestic product, with data here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP). This implies that there is a natural level of investment in commodities, compared to GDP.

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.64 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 14.6 +/- 10%. The high uncertainty here is largely because the correlation got markedly worse in 2005, around the time of global financial crisis. Commodities suffered a bubble and pop, with a peak in June of 2008. In addition to the demand fluctuation related to the global financial crisis, this was the time that massive oil and natural gas investment was occurring, which ended up crashing the prices until recently.

Even though commodities have the highest expected return, the high uncertainty make stocks more desirable. If I was only going to go with one, I would go with stocks. However, for now I intend to move bonds into stocks, and keep commodities.

**Back testing:**

I worked out an optimal back tested strategy ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC\_izY14qAa7zdSm\_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC_izY14qAa7zdSm_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing) \-&gt; Data sheet, toward the right). With this I find the following CAGRs, from January, 1970 to January, 2021.

Stocks only: 10.93%

Bonds only: 7.18%

Commodities only: 6.79%

Stock and Bonds: 13.42%

Stocks and Commodities and Bonds: 17.18%.

For each of these, I use the indicators from six months prior to the current date. This happens to give better results, as well as being possible without a time machine. I switch the entire portfolio to the best investment once a month, where the best investment has a fudge factor. That is, if expected stock return &gt; expected bond return + 0.8%, I go with stocks. Otherwise I go with bonds. If I wish to look at commodities, If find that it almost never a good idea to choose commodities over stocks. However, if expected bonds return &gt; expected commodity return + 0.5%, I stick with bonds. Otherwise, I stay go with commodities. As of November, 2022, this procedure recommends switching from commodities to stocks.

**Actual Results:**

I've been doing this long enough, and posting about it to reddit long enough, that I can start to have a verified track record, as opposed to back testing only. This only includes what I posted to reddit, not what I've actually done with my portfolio, which is significantly more complicated and impossible to prove.

March 2021, recommended stocks [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_not/)

This is the default case, so no comment

July 2021, recommended bonds [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_the/)

This performed much worse than I expected. I was correct that stocks were in danger. I made the faulty assumption that bonds are low risk. The combination of very low initial interest rates and the surprise (to me) very high inflation caused the worst bond sell off in US history. I did not see this coming.

April 2022, recommended commodities [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks\_vs\_bonds\_vs\_commodities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities/)

This performed okay, I guess. But the recommendation was late (after Russian invaded Ukraine).

In the table ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC\_izY14qAa7zdSm\_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSHryGSdk3idC_izY14qAa7zdSm_3LLsZA2MNybyAIg/edit?usp=sharing)  \-&gt; Reddit record), I'm shifting the dates one month later, to avoid any hint of look ahead bias.

Following my recommendations would have lead an account to fall from 100 to 83. Doing stocks alone would fall to 94. Bonds alone would fall to 86. Commodities alone would risen from 100 to 143. So my practical, actual return is poor, primarily because of how badly I whiffed on the bonds recommendation. There was also some chasing the last good thing, with commodities. Using my current rules in a back test, the account would have risen from 100 to 143 (and been commodities till now).

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* AIEA measures a natural level for stock vs bond ownership. This is not a fundamental parameter, with an underlying theory about why the natural level should be where it is, or will remain the same in the future.

t3_yefuin|1666837046.0|investing|Question on long term loss and wash sale wrt vesting|"Trying to understand if wash sale rules will trigger or not, based on vesting. 

So every yearly my employer gives me vested stock at EOY. Since my the vests happen in EOY and last nov stocks tanked, I’d like to nullify my losses but have another vest around the same timing. Need to understand if wash sale rule will apply while trying to nullify long term loss. 

Example:
Year 1, stock value 50, units 100 = $5000

Year 2, stock value 100, units 100 = $10000 + $5000 as long term profit on lot 1 (since price instead from 50 to 100 post holding)

Year 3, stock value 75, units 100 = $7500. Lot 3 - no loss/profit. Lot 2, has a long term gain(loss) of -$2500. Lot 1 has long term gain of $2500. None of the lots are sold yet. 

Scenario 1: If at year 3, I decide to sell lot 1 &amp; 2, I can get zero gain for my income since long term profit and losses can negate each other (please do correct me if that is also wrong 😓). Note, I technically also bought lot 3 at year 3, but that should not trigger a wash sale imo 🤞

Scenario 2: If at year 3, I decide to sell all the lots 1,2,3 - will that trigger a wash sale? In this particular use case, I have bought lot 3, since those have vested and are considered “bought” and I sold that lot as well. 

Please advice 😭

Best scenario would be to need to not trigger wash sale but still be able to sell something from my lots and not pay short/long term taxes."|0.6|1.0|0.0|1.0

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.brs.org/?zone=/unionactive/view\_article.cfm&amp;HomeID=881487](https://www.brs.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&amp;HomeID=881487)

&amp;#x200B;

October 26, 2022, FRONT ROYAL, VIRGINIA — Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen President Michael Baldwin announced today that the union’s members voted against ratification of the National Tentative Agreement reached on September 15. The BRS represents more than 6,000 members affected by the negotiations.

&amp;#x200B;

The results are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

6,339 Ballots were mailed.

&amp;#x200B;

4,639 (73.18% participation) Ballots were received with the following results:

&amp;#x200B;

1,820 (39.23 % of Received Ballots) Yes, Approve

2,810 (60.57% of Received Ballots) No, Do Not Approve

9 (.2% of Received Ballots) Spoiled Ballots

&amp;#x200B;

The BRS negotiated this round of bargaining as a member of the Coordinated Bargaining Coalition (CBC) and later the United Rail Unions\*, which eventually comprised all rail unions with members under National handling. Collectively, the coalitions represented over 115,000 rail workers. The BRS was one of the last three unions at the bargaining table.

&amp;#x200B;

President Baldwin stated, “For the first time that I can remember, the BRS members voted not to ratify a National Agreement, and with the highest participation rate in BRS history. I have expressed my disappointment throughout the process in the lack of good-faith bargaining on the part of the NCCC, as well as the part PEB 250 played in denying BRS members the basic right of paid time off for illness. The NCCC and PEB also both failed to recognize the safety-sensitive and highly stressful job BRS members perform each day to keep the railroad running and supply chain flowing. Without Signalmen, the roadways and railroad crossings would be unsafe for the traveling public, and they shoulder that heavy burden each day. Additionally, the highest offices at each Carrier, as well as their stockholders, seem to forget that the rank-and-file of their employees continued to perform their job each day through an unprecedented pandemic, while the executives worked from home to keep their families safe.”

&amp;#x200B;

Despite a cap and freeze on healthcare with no negative changes to the plan, General Wage Increases of 22% (24% compounded), and an agreement to bargain on the responsibility pay that Signalmen have been trying to get since 2011, BRS members spoke loudly and clearly that their contributions are worth more, particularly when it comes to a basic right of being able to take time off for illness or to prevent illness.

&amp;#x200B;

The rejection of the National Tentative Agreement results in a “status quo” period where the BRS will reengage with the NCCC. More information will follow.

&amp;#x200B;

\*The unions comprising the Coordinated Bargaining Coalition were: the American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA); the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen / Teamsters Rail Conference (BLET); the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (BRS); the International Association of Machinists (IAM); the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers (IBB); the National Conference of Firemen &amp; Oilers/SEIU (NCFO); the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW); the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU); the Transportation Communications Union / IAM (TCU), including TCU’s Brotherhood Railway Carmen Division (BRC); and the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers (SMART–TD). The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division and SMART Mechanical Unions are also bargaining as a coalition. Collectively, these Unions represent approximately 115,000 railroad workers covered by the various organizations’ national agreements, and comprised 100% of the workforce impacted by this round of negotiations."|0.7|13.0|0.0|13.0

It positions itself as an an ethical index fund.|"I was listening to Pod Save America recently and one of their new advertisers DEMZ is an ETF that is positioned at people who like to buy index funds, but want to avoid investing in companies that actively donate to US Republican candidates and lobby for Republican agenda items. This cuts out a good number of S&amp;P 500 companies like Exxon Mobile, Lockheed Martin, etc. But the idea is that it is still a diversified large cap ETF that aims to replicate performance of the S&amp;P.

One downside I see is the 0.45% expense ratio, which isn't bad for an ETF in general, but feels very high compared to my Vanguard funds that are all under 0.1%. VTSAX is literally 0.04% so investing in this would be more than 10x the fees - though still not terribly high. One would swallow this as the extra cost of investing in a way that aligns more with my politics and ethics.

The Securities and Exchange Commission voted Wednesday to adopt such a rule, one of the few remaining that were mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed in response to the financial crisis of 2007-2010.

The rule will “strengthen the transparency and quality of corporate financial statements, investor confidence in those statements, and the accountability of corporate executives to investors,” SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said in a statement.

Companies listed on U.S. exchanges will be required to establish compensation-recovery policies that would be triggered any time the company restates its earnings. If the misstatements led to incentive-based compensation, the company must recover those funds.

The rule requires companies to claw back compensation when it finds both “big R” earnings restatements, which require companies to alert investors and reissue financial reports from previous years, and “little r” revisions, which are less serious and don’t require that investors be alerted.

Financial-reform advocates have worried since the rule [was first proposed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/secs-clawback-proposal-leaves-a-big-loophole-2015-07-02?mod=article_inline) in 2015 that a decline in the number of more serious earnings restatements and a rise in the number of less serious revisions is being driven by companies pressuring accountants and auditors into massaging results in order to reduce the need for full restatements."|0.96|119.0|0.0|119.0

1. Generating monstrous free cash flow each with their own future potential growth areas. All of these companies have proven highly innovative with very solid managements, especially AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT, who are sort of in their own little tier.

2. Still have massive user bases, pricing power and most of us use their services daily. This is really the crux of the appeal to me. I don’t get how people compare these to Pets.com or even Yahoo. From what I see, they’re practically inescapable and on avg each person reading this thread probably contributes hundreds of dollars to each of their top lines yearly, either directly or indirectly.

3. For the ones that are less “gold plated” when it comes to the core of their business aka Meta and Netflix, they are currently trading at much much saner multiples than before, especially Meta, and still are solid businesses with moats and tons of FCF. 

I feel Netflix still offers the best service amongst the streaming platforms and is an innovative enough company to maintain its profitability and growth. It also has streaming as its core bread and butter business unlike AMZN and arguably Disney. 

Re: Meta, Metaverse may look like a weird bet but the VR/AR tech they’re investing in is absolutely industry leading and FB ads still have a massive moat in digital advertising thanks to Insta. Current valuation is a bargain when you consider their profits and growth. 

Hence, I feel there’s a decent rational logic to buying these stocks over the next year or so keeping a 10 year + horizon in mind. They might get killed over the next 1-2-3 whatever years but I find them to offer solid and reliable value. Thoughts?"|0.66|1.0|0.0|1.0

I know I’m about to get crucified for this, but I believe that putting aside morality of the reasons for the economic downturn, the downturn has been a blessing in disguise. Before this we have had a 13 year bull market. By all objective cyclically adjusted ratios, whether that is [cape](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) or [excess cape](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/27100/us-shiller-ecy), we were just shy of reaching insanity levels akin to the late 1990s but were stopped in our tracks. From feb 2020 (pre-pandemic) to dec 2021 stock market rallied about 42%. The fed - counting inflation through a basket of goods has increased money supply a lot, and while the prices of consumer goods may not changed much, real estate prices worldwide have exploded, with [house price to median income higher than at the peak of the housing bubble](https://www.realestatewitch.com/house-price-to-income-ratio-2021/) in UK and US, although the factors at play for real estate seem to be different this time (not so much a bubble as a lack of supply)

The truth is that covid, rolling lockdowns in China, the war in Ukraine and the subsequent inflation and rate hikes have been caused by arbitrary geopolitical circumstances (from economic pov) rather than fundamental economic issues. Without these external factors there was no sign of economic slowdown and we would have been marching on, head straight into a mega-bubble the likes of the 90s if not much bigger.

The only worry I have right is now that people have been accustomed to the previous bull market and everyone is waiting for the fed pivot for another asset price boom to happen. You should hope to god that is not the case. We’re just barely starting to see more or less fair valuations on forward pe earnings (around 15x) while cyclical ratios still look overvalued and real estate prices are still high. Another asset price boom will lead us into the dangerous territories that post-covid supply chains issues and oil price shocks have prevented us going from. As young investors (as I think most of us are) we should be hoping for a protracted bear market and cheap valuations for long term capital appreciation rather than a quick buck in the next year or two"|0.82|112.0|0.0|112.0

The article contains quite a lot of visuals. Unfortunately, those aren't allowed here. So I wrote down the article without the visuals. The visuals can be found on my Substack.

That aside, let's dive deeper into this very interesting company.

**Intro**

For our Halloween celebration piece, we figured that Carriage Services would be a great choice (just kidding it was a coincidence). But today’s choice features the topic of death services including, burials, cremations, and all other funeral services. We believe that analyzing this company with a top-down approach will be the best way to approach the company.

**The Numbers**

* CSV has a decent revenue 3-year annual growth rate of 15%.
* CSV has a decent ROIC of 23%, indicating that each $100 invested in the business results in an additional $23 of operating income.
* CSV has a decent gross margin of 33%, indicating that it has strong pricing power.
* CSV has a solid FCF of 15%, which indicates that the company could buy itself back in about 8 years.
* Forward PE: At the current valuation CSV has a forward PE of 11.15.

**Starting from the Top**

First of all, we would like to begin with the macroeconomic perspective of the company. We will take a look at some of the headwinds that carriage will be facing in the coming days.

The first consequential trend in death rates. Since covid, I am sure you can imagine that death rates did in fact increase, and this will lead to an impact on topline revenue in the short run (there is already an impact, and it is mild in our opinion). Below you can see the obvious increase in death rates from covid and the flatlining post covid.

Clearly, there has been a large increase in deaths each year. We believe this trend will most likely continue through the next decade. Mainly due to the fact that the baby boomer population ages further and Americans continue to get much older. Below is the forecast for a 48% increase in older Americans over the next 20 years.

As you can understand, this has large implications for the industry. We believe this will allow for long-term growth over the coming decades. This isn’t insane growth (a CAGR of about 2%) but, this will help push the industry along. It is definitely a bullish outlook for the industry as a whole.

Due to the fact that an aging population means a higher number of deaths over the coming decades, with the death rate pre-covid flatlining at around 79 years old (showing no signs of improvement). So, love it or hate it, this is the reality that the death services industry is facing in the coming decades.

**Cremations are in demand**

This obviously is a good thing for the company, but, probably not good for the cremated.

For years, analysts and investors have been worried about the effect of cremations on the profits of death services companies and that is still a worry today. This would be a significant headwind but, we have great news for any would-be investors, just check out the charts below and you tell us if you notice an impact.

Clearly, revenues have increased (along with EBITDA) for years, so I don’t think there’s too much to worry about! My mindset is along the lines of the CEO, and that’s if they aren’t feeling any impacts with cremations being 57% of the market then I think the future bodes well. This ability to maintain growth is due to amazing acquisitions and good management, which is the overall theme of this company. In addition, it doesn’t hurt that gross margins are even higher on cremations.

**A Little History**

Carriage services has gone a long way in its 30 years of service. Ran by the same CEO, who is now 78, for those 30 years, they have experienced a wealth of change that has led them to become the high-functioning company that they are today.

In the 90s, the company almost went under like most companies in the industry due to overleveraging their way to massive growth. After that debacle the company had to try to fix the disaster, they had formed. They were able to do this in the following 7 years.

How you may ask? By getting rid of waste, deleveraging, and focusing on cash flow they were able to become a decent company in the mid-2000s and that’s when this CEO really turned this company into what they are today.

**Growth By Acquisition**

In this paragraph, we will be discussing the growth by acquisition of the company and we will be discussing the competition.

After the downfall, the CEO/Founder began to decentralize the company. He shredded middle management, then proceeded to focus and raise his standards for the quality of managers that he would have at the localized level. After finding top-notch local managers he was able to push more responsibility at a local level and allow these great managers to be more agile and adjust to the local needs. This corresponded to the company’s strategy of growth through acquisition, by utilizing these great managers to increase margins. The next goal was to develop a strong strategy of buying great companies that had strong upside potential. Starting in 2010 they began to build a new system of buying companies and these are still roughly the standards they operate with today.

Clearly, they look for price, but all these other standards they have created ensure that they are able to get great companies for a great price. Now, you might be thinking that they could run out of businesses to buy. But, according to carriage services the market is only getting better, as most of the industry is privately owned (and family). Furthermore, most owners are aging and are willing to sell their companies for cheap to a consolidator that will treat it well.

Their only public competitor, which grows in a similar fashion, is SCI. SCI operates similarly but at a much larger scale than what carriage services operates and is the industry’s biggest player. Overall, the companies only control less than 20% of the total market and this leads to plenty of room for both companies to grow so competition is not a problem from an acquisition standpoint for the foreseeable future.

When CSV acquires new companies, they immediately increase profitability and margins to get the most value out of their acquisitions. The company’s ability to allow their motivated and elite localized management systems to independently (and effectively) operate has enabled this great margin expansion in new acquisitions. Surprisingly, great managers, when left to their own vices, are great at managing things! This is why their decentralized approach is so important to future growth.

See the chart below for how well they do (same-store implies a store that they have had for at least 5 years):

**Management and Capital Allocation**

If you look at this company, there is no inherent moat, just like every other company in the industry. What carriage does have is a great CEO and a great management team who is ready to take the reins when he leaves.

If you read his letters, it is precisely the type of CEO that is written about in the book “The Outsiders”. He is constantly trying to innovate separately from his competitors and run a streamlined decentralized company. His ability to hop on cheap debt and turn that into value for shareholders cannot be praised enough as he has done throughout the last 20 years. We expect a clean transfer of power as he is already allowing other managers to control meetings and company direction with a hands-off approach, which sets up an easy transfer later to mitigate risk when he leaves.

They operate on a 5-year plan that is updated every 5 years to achieve their goals. This has been the case since 2005 and will most likely continue into future years. Their current strategy for capital allocation can be found in the listed points below:

* Acquiring a company that meets the standards of the list I shared before (they are planning on acquiring 2 companies this quarter)
* Debt Reduction (this is a current focus)
* If an adequate company is not available, then buying back shares is a preferred method.
   * Share prices must be 10% below their estimated intrinsic value of the company (which is currently $75 a share). They have retired 20% of dilutive shares since Q2 2021 (their 4th time buying back shares)

Management rarely holds boatloads of cash and is constantly looking for ways to allocate it. They also run a trust which operates at roughly the same amount of returns the last 10 years as the S&amp;P 500.

This will most likely improve through a downturn and could lead to an increase in their balance sheet. Management operates at beautiful ROICs, the first half of this year they operated at a 20% ROIC. This is consistent with what this management has been able to produce historically. Their FCF margins are simply incredible year after year and is due to blatant focus by management to increase and then allocate effectively. In the case, their stock crashes due to current macroeconomic conditions not pertaining to CSV's business model. We are confident that the company will buy back shares by the truckload. In addition, it should be mentioned that CSV refinanced their $400M in senior notes from May 2026 at 6.625% to May 2029 at 4.25%, which added significant value to the company (I also believe this is how they funded the mass amount of share buybacks).

**Insider Purchases**

As you can see in the table below, the insiders have been quite active lately. This is good to see and gives even more strength to our thesis. In particular, seeing the COO increase his stake by a significant amount is what we like to see.

**The Charts**

As can be seen on the chart below CSV currently has a YTD bottom of around $30. If the market continues to deteriorate, we could see the price drop toward the $29 support level. This would mean more downside is possible.

We can see the stock is falling together with the market as it is currently down close to 52% since its ATH of late December last year. Currently, the stock has found some support on the 200WMA, which you will be able to see in the chart below. Ideally, we would like to see the stock stay above the crucial $29 support level. If that support isn’t able to hold, we could see more downside and CSV would become an increasingly attractive opportunity. We believe the stock provides a very enticing buy opportunity on every dip below $30.

**CSV 1-year chart**

Now let’s have a look at the long-term chart. We can clearly see the stock is having a rough time. The stock has fallen close to 52% since its all-time high, as we mentioned above.

CSV does have a strong business as we discussed in this article. We believe the company is poised to grow further. Although, the company might struggle due to current macroeconomic headwinds, we believe this is a strong company is one to keep an eye on for the long-term. As you can see, the stock found some support on the 200WSMA as we already mentioned above. In addition, we got the up trending green support line, which should act as a very strong support level. We would like the stock to break above the current $84 resistance level. Afterward, we would like to see the stock break out of the steep downtrend that it has been in since last year.

**CSV 5-Year Chart**

**Valuation and Expectations**

To conclude this article, we would like to talk a little bit more about the valuations and expectations that we have for CSV.

CSV’s growth was expected to slouch this past quarter as they had stated, they increased overhead to update their facilities and technology since they needed to modernize everything. This was a planned event, but the market still seems to have missed the memo and they immediately fell off drastically.

We believe this creates one of the best opportunities in the market to get an undervalued company for an absolute steal. They are currently priced at $31.45 a share after undergoing some macroeconomic headwinds with covid ending, higher interest rates leading to a lower market, and a rougher than expected 2nd quarter/ I agree with management, and I get a value of about $72/share using a DCF with 15% CAGR and a 5% discount rate.

Furthermore, I expect that to be realized as revenue settles out over the next couple of quarters. They might not seem cheap with an 11x EV/EBIT but I believe due to numerous factors including being in an industry that is not heavily impacted by recessions along with second-to-none management, this company deserves a much higher stock price. If we take this management and the pretty stable industry into consideration, we don’t think we have to project any major impact from a large recession for this business. Taking this into consideration, we get a high multiple and a 50%+ margin of safety on a consistent business with consistent returns.

To us, that sounds pretty good. We believe that below $30 it is definitely a stock to keep an eye on.

**Disclosure**: I currently have no position in the company. It is important to say that my co-writer does have a position within the company and might extend his position further in the next 72 hours."|0.68|8.0|0.0|8.0

Many people I know have sold their assets due to inflation. A disciplined investor can prepare for inflation by investing in asset classes that outperform the market in inflationary environments. There are various ways to protect against inflation including hedge funds. It generally has helped enhance overall returns and reduce overall risk. \[Hedge funds are financial organizations that are often privately owned and run like Yieldstreet and Hedonova\].

These are some alternatives you can consider to invest in:

  
**Gold** has frequently been touted as an inflation hedge. In reality, a lot of individuals have considered gold to be an ""alternative currency,"" especially in nations where the national currency is depreciating.

**Vintage Cars:** Investing in old cars, though tricky, can still be profitable and a good way to diversify your portfolio. You can try The HAGI Top Index, which tracks vintage collectible cars from Porsche, Ferrari, Bugatti, Alfa Romeo and other brands since not all vintage cars are valuable in the long run.  


**Wine.**  
A unique bottle of wine increases in value with time and with inflation, much like a classic car. Wine, on the other hand, is intended to be drank. The value of the remaining bottles of wine may increase when one bottle of a rare vintage is consumed.  


**Real estate.**  
Investors in real estate have a variety of options, including single-family, multi-family, and commercial properties, to explore as a hedge against inflation. You can use EquityMultiple or Fundrise for that. However, making an investment in commercial real estate frequently calls for a huge sum of money. There are a lot of things you need to consider too like which state the property is in, the quality of the property, etc.

# Introduction

## Background

Intel used to be a giant in the microchip and semiconductor sector, but recently it found itself eclipsed by its competitor in matters of quality, strategic development and public perception. Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.

## Purpose

The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).

All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

## Hypothesis

* INTC is not a dying company
* INTC downtrend is following the sector and the market movement
* INTC is a cyclical business, and we are in a down cycle
* INTC investments will boost its revenues in the next five years
* USA government will not allow one of its pivotal and strategic company to fail
* INTC will face more stress as AMD is eating market share
* INTC’s new products are the top-notch of the sector

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

## Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|**Levered Beta**|**0.71**|
|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.54**|
|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|
|**WACC**|**6.45%**|
|Hurdle Rate|11.64%|
|**ROE**|**25.50%**|
|**EPS**|**4.66**|
|**P/E**|**5.65**|
|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|
|Corp Tax|8.46%|
|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|
|Analyst growth estimate|\-0.16%|
|Next 5y Analysts growth|12.80%|
|Intel’s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|
|Outstanding Shares|4,106,000,000|
|Earnings distributed|28.41%|
|Earnings retained|71.59%|

# Macro Economic Data

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return|9.40%|
|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|
|Risk Premium|5.19%|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|
|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|
|Current Market P/E|18.58|

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of 30 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.45% and its Growth Rate of 18.26% to determine a fair value of **$23.57** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|18.26|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$97.53**

&amp;#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|18.26%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,106,000,000|

## Dividend Discount Model

The dividend discount model (DDM) is a quantitative method used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value.

The model gives a negative number when companies have a lower rate of return compared to the dividend growth rate. This may happen when a company continues to pay dividends even if it is incurring a loss or relatively lower earnings, as per Intel Case. This makes this model not good to be used alone when evaluating a business.

Knowing this, the model is still used here, mainly because the final price tag is determined by the average of all the methods. This choice is made by the necessity of conservative estimates and cautious predictions. The discounted rating used here is the CAPM of 7.01%.

The model gives the following result:

|Fair Value, taking in count a perpetual growth rate. Here we used the company growth rate of 18.26% and not the average growth rate of the dividends. This is due to the fact that the price given by the dividend growth is considered to be unrealistic for the next five years.|$-15.36|
|:-|:-|
|Fair Value assuming a zero growth in the dividends' growth. This price is not used to determine the final value due to the fact that the company has historically paid dividends with constant growth, and it is predicted to not stop this trend.|$24.62|

&amp;#x200B;

## Total Payout Model

It is a variation of the DDF that takes in count shares repurchases. With 5.64 Billion paid in dividend in 2021, discount rate of 7.01% (CAPM) and growth rate of 18.26%, this model gives us a price tag of -**$12.22**

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$23.57|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$97.53|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|$56.67|
|Dividend Discount Model|$-15.36|
|Total Payout Model|\-$12.22|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$30.04**|

&amp;#x200B;

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

# The Products

|**CGC – Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|
|:-|
|**NEX – Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|
|**DCAI – Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|
|**AXG – Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|
|**IFS – Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|
|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|

* **High level of debt**: It has a lot of debt, which increases the interest costs on funds borrowed to finance activities.
* **Declining PC sales**: the PC market is shrinking due to post Covid open up and cycle of the business
* **High Dependency on the Main Segment**: Intel has a strong dependency on PC sales
* **Limited Business Diversification**: Intel is facing challenges in diversifying. It is trying to enter the mobile phone, tablet and TV segments.
* **Limited Customer Care in Developing Countries**: the company’s customer care is less active in developing countries, missing new potential customers

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&amp;C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&amp;E

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $30.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

First of all wishing you all a very Happy Diwali and Happy Halloween. I am investing in the US market via a platform called Vested Finance [https://vestedfinance.com/in/](https://vestedfinance.com/in/) They are registered with the SEC [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/299272](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/299272) [https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/crs/crs\_299272.pdf](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/crs/crs_299272.pdf) Kinda like RobinHood. They have tied up with DriveWealth. Anyways the experience has been okayish so far. Recently they sent this mail to their users

*Vested's primary objectives has always been to make cross-border investments* ***easy, secure,*** *and* ***affordable***  *for all our users. In our efforts to meet those objectives, Vested has  made available an automatic bank sweep vehicle on your free cash in your  investment account. The sweep program is FDIC-insured for up to  $250,000 in cash, enabling you to collect a competitive interest rate on  free cash balances. Effective Nov 19, 2022, due to increased  administrative clearing costs, the effective paid interest rate of this  program will be reduced by a certain percentage to accommodate Vested  for this service.*  
 

***What does this mean for me?***

*As  a user of Vested, your free cash balances in your Investment Account  will continue to be covered by U.S. FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per  account, and you will continue to receive interest into your account on  this cash. Your account is automatically included in this program.*  
 

***Is there any action required from me?*** 

*As  stated above, your existing registered Vested Account is already  included in the program, and there is no additional action that you need  to take at this time.*  
 

*You can elect to opt-out of this program, and you can do so by emailing the Vested Service Team at* [*help@vestedfinance.co*](mailto:help@vestedfinance.co)*.* ***If you elect to opt-out, your free cash balances will not earn any interest but will still enjoy FDIC insurance.***  
 

*The Cash Management Sweep program is managed by our clearing broker partner. For more information, please review their* [*program disclosure*](https://vested.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4be6dced2f8f027c9d1b68acc&amp;id=99fb82a932&amp;e=2fafae6fdb)*.*

&amp;#x200B;

I reached out to them and here is what they replied

 ***The interest rate changes monthly, as a function of the  overall interest rate environment. In September, the effective interest  rate was 1.37% (annual rate). When the new policy becomes effective on  19th November 2022, if the interest rate is the same, the user would  receive interest on their idle cash at a 0.34% annual rate.*** 

 ***Vested still supports commission-free trading. The reduction  in interest rate for the program, is to support an increase in  administrative clearing costs. DriveWealth currently only offers two  options for Vested users, where the user can either opt-out of the bank  sweep program interest, or opt-in at a reduced interest rate.***   
***Vested  does not have control over the money that is wired to your DriveWealth  brokerage account. DriveWealth manages order execution and bank sweeps  from your account, but only at your direction.*** 

TLDR- The interest rate is 1.37% annually, as of now, and come 19th November Vested will take a cut of 1.03% and if the user does not want Vested to take the cut then the user will have to let go of the 0.34% interest also.  They are taking 75% of the monthly interest amount. 

Is this even allowed by the SEC? I mean a user is wiring money to DriveWealth and DriveWealth is giving interest to the user. Now Vested is asking a cut out of it and if the user does not agree to that then the user will have to let go of the whole interest. Doesn't this sound weird to you? Also DriveWealth is supposed to credit interest to a user's account then how will Vested take their share out of it?  What if a user does not give permission to DriveWealth to give his/her interest to Vested, then can they still take the 75% share  that they are asking for?   


Reached out to DriveWealth and they are like go talk to Vested. Can apps like Vested/Robinhood etc. do this? Is there any nodal or appellate team in the SEC from where we can clarify this? Will they even reply to investors who are not based in the US?

It says “Investors should be aware of extremely high yields, since there is an inverse relationship between stock price and dividend yield and the distribution might not be sustainable.
Stocks that pay dividends typically provide stability to a portfolio, but do not usually outperform high-quality growth stocks.”

The way I interpret this is that a stock that provides a regular dividend to its investors, is showing signs that it is financially stable enough to do so, but investors should still keep in mind that if it’s a high dividend, the company could be paying investors too much?

* I. Is increase in current assets good or bad? Increase in current assets means that the company is investing in its operations and also means that the working capital ratio will potentially improve. On the other hand, it means that the cash outflow will be bigger than the cash inflow (right?) and then that changes in WC will be negative;
* II. What about decrease in current liabilities? Is it good or bad? It will get worse the WC ratio but it'll provide a cash inflow bigger than the cash outflow - which results in a positive change in WC; 
* III. What is better, a positive change in WC or a negative change in WC?

They manufacture many kinds of copper wires and cables with applications in data centers, renewable energy, residential &amp; commercial buildings, etc. They run a tight operation all under one roof and are an industry-leading supplier in the US for these cables.

I've been trying to make sense of the numbers. They have a 30-year track record of profitability and growth, and each quarter they have been posting has record levels of revenue &amp; profit. The last reported quarter Q2 2022 was $838m in revenue and $210m in profit.

Looking at TTM, this stock is trading at 3.8x p/e. On top of that, they have ZERO debt and $470m cash according to their latest investor presentation (June 2022).

These numbers seem almost too good to be true because it seems like a long-term investor's dream. High growth and amazing valuation with a strong balance sheet. I also noticed this stock has a relatively high short interest at 13% of float, so I'm not sure what to make of it.

t3_ybph4w|1666550537.0|investing|Buy-write fund like SPXX: what are the pluses and minuses?|"I saw a recommendation for [SPXX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPXX?p=SPXX), a fund that:

&gt; [is designed to offer regular distributions](https://www.nuveen.com/en-us/closed-end-funds/spxx-nuveen-s-p-500-dynamic-overwrite-fund) through a strategy that seeks attractive total return with less volatility than the S&amp;P 500 Index by investing in a U.S. equity portfolio that seeks to substantially replicate the price movements of the S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as selling call options on 35%-75% of the notional value of the Fund's equity portfolio (with a 55% long-term target) in an effort to enhance the Fund's risk-adjusted returns.

So it seems it holds the SP500, and writes covered calls on it, sacrificing upside in return for premiums.   There are probably lots of buy-write funds like this, and I own a little of another one.

The gushing recommendation was based on the idea that the market is oversold and a recession is priced in (flip a coin on this one; I say no).

SPXX  yields 7.3%.    It is usually less volatile than SP500, but when SP500 does something crazy, it follows it (it went from 19.75 to 9.23 from 2007 to 2009, and went from 16.47 to 11.58 in the 2020 panic).

The dividends since 2009 were rather flat, but solid at around today's 7%.      I'd argue that given the past decade's 2% inflation,  it has earned a real 5% because neither the value nor the dividend grew much.   Assuming federal plus state 20% taxation on dividends and capital gains, the real return drops to 4% if it isn't held in a retirement fund.  But for someone earning under $100K, total tax will be closer to 10%, and real yield is 4.75%.

So I'd say the following about this and similar funds

* they sacrifice market upside and dividend growth because of covered call losses

* they tend to yield a solid above-inflation return

* like covered calls, the downside has limited protection, and can suffer worse than the overall market, for some reason (eg 2009, 2020) - maybe it writes covered calls into a dip and loses upside, the equivalent of selling low.

Still, it looks like it it could be a relatively stable way of extracting  a real 5% rate of return from the market. 

Are there any upsides or downsides I don't see?  I read a 10 year old thread that said it's better to buy a junk-bond index but these yield about 5.6%, and are not taxed at cap gains / dividend rates, so they yield about 2.5% after taxes and inflation."|0.63|4.0|0.0|4.0

Yields fell at those times because (a) return of capital was more appealing than return on capital (b) there was an assumption the global economy would shrink.

Inflation has increased rapidly because of two one-off global supply shocks. The Fed and other rate setters responded by hiking rates and promising to continue hiking aggressively, which goes against traditional theory (rate hikes work for demand led inflation).

It is widely expected the global economy cannot handle higher rates. Too much leverage, too much QE to unwind, companies issued bonds to do share buybacks, households buy cars on hire purchase and buy houses with low deposits.

There are currently two major crises, including a proxy world war. The pandemic could rear its head again over the flu period. China could invade Taiwan and cut off the world's major supplier of semiconductors. Did the European debt crisis stop being an issue? Do Greece and Spain have far better economies than ten years ago, following the pandemic and supply shortages? All of this should cause a human to think a reckoning is coming.

Yet instead sovereign bond yields have rocketed. 

Everything I've seen about the significant drops in bond values simply say ""Fixed income is a poor choice during periods of rising inflation"". 

But this feels like what a computer would say.

It ignores the return **of** capital element for sovereign debt, which should be invaluable during all these huge crises. This return of capital element was beneficial during all the relatively minor crises since 2008. So why not now? 

It also assumes that commodities, property and some equities will do well. Hypothetically, they all do well during periods of high inflation. People ditch bonds to buy property and commodities. But thats only during demand led inflation. Commodities have spiked in price, but that will only last until the economy slows. Property can't stay at these prices if the Fed (etc) follows through with the rate hikes the markets have already priced in. Bond values have priced in these future aggressive rate hikes, yet property hasn't (some areas are flat, some down slightly, some up slightly - none of which factors in a 5/6% Fed rate).

So, what gives? People see a headline inflation rate of 10% and think ""ditch bonds/buy commodities"" without factoring in all the very realistic negative implications of the world war? 

German 10 year bonds were negative a year ago. People were guaranteeing a loss of euro for 10 full years because they felt a return of capital was more important than a return on capital, because they thought the pandemic would wreck the global economy Now they're at 2.5%. In that time, the supplier of 40% of Germany's gas has started a war on Germany's doorstep. [Edit to add - in case anyone says ""German bonds have spiked because they are a greater credit risk because of their dependence on Russia"" - all global yields have spiked, and Germany still lags way behind USA/UK, so that's not the issue here. People were willing to lose euro a year ago because return of capital was important, now that isn't valuable despite a significant and material increase in risk in the meantime]"|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0

All offer interesting rates - What's the most recommended for ~1 year maturity?|"Assume I want to have the money back at around 1 year from now, with a profit of course. Let's say, **maximum on the 1st of March 2024**.

I got a lot of help from you guys in my previous post, and that made me check the **Bonds** section on the IBKR web platform.

There are quite a few categories there, and from my exploration, it seems like it is possible to get some decent coupons nowadays, of course, depending on the risk.

I wonder where should I put my money. Or how to diversify it. I have around 100K$.

* **T-bills** are very safe and can generate around 4.5% nowadays as I see.
* **CDs** have the same yield as bills, but the money is stuck without the ability to get it till maturity. So they are less attractive.
* **Corporate bonds** are riskier but some have good risk/reward with rates at around 8%.
* **Muni bonds** are an interesting thing I came across right now. As I understand, It is pretty safe because it is issued by governmental entities. Most of them are a bit overpriced right now with coupons at around 4%.
* **Non-US gov bonds** have also some interesting offerings at around 4-5%.

As I see it, it's better to buy the **US t-bills** as they are presumably the safest and generate yield pretty much as all the other ones.

Let me explain what I mean.

I'm currently trying to build out a dividend aristocrat portfolio which consists of both American based ones as well as international ones.

I've noticed something quite interesting to me, American dividend aristocrats have a significantly lower average yield than do international counterparts.

Take for example ZDY a US dividend aristocrat ETF, during the bottom of the Covid crash the yield was around 5.5%.

By contrast, ZDI an international dividend aristocrat ETF had a yield at the time of around 7.5%.

I checked some papers to confirm if this is consistent and it is.

What has left me still wondering however if it has always been this way, but have not found enough info out there to know with certainty.

So, I wanted to ask you guys, for the top history finance econ buff, was the average American dividend aristocrat yield ever at one point higher than it's international counterparts or has it always been this way?

2)  What does bond price mean? Is it the price you can buy it at?  Does this price increase or decrease in the future or is it fixed? 

3) If I buy a bond today and sell it tomorrow without holding it for 30 years or 3 months how can I make money? Do I need yields to go up or down in order for it to be in my favour? How would a swing trade work for the bond market?

4) Why would anyone ever want to buy the 3 month bond it has the lowest interest rate it makes no sense for anyone to buy it. Why does the 30 year yield have lower interest rate then the 12 month yield? Isnt it best just to buy the bond with the highest yield get the first instalment and sell the bond?

The employee contribution limit for 401(k) and similar workplace plans will jump $2,000 to $22,500 for 2023, the largest increase ever in terms of dollars and percentage, according to benefits provider Milliman.

The amount taxpayers can contribute to an individual retirement account will be $6,500 for 2023, up from $6,000. The limit hasn’t changed since 2019.

The 401(k) catch-up contribution amount allowed if you are 50 or older will rise $1,000 to $7,500 for 2023. The catch-up contribution limit for individual retirement accounts, which isn’t subject to inflation adjustments, remains at $1,000.

For workers at companies that allow special after-tax contributions, and self-employed folks who have individual 401(k)s or SEP retirement plans, there is a total $66,000 plan contribution limit for 2023, up $5,000 from this year. That includes employee and employer contributions. With catch-up contributions on top, older savers can contribute up to $73,500 in 2023 to these plans.

The retirement news follows Tuesday’s announcement of adjustments to income tax brackets and dozens of other adjustments including the estate and gift tax exclusion, made annually under formulas set by Congress.

The higher limits offer a big savings opportunity.

“You may not feel the pinch now, and you’ll reap the rewards later in retirement,” says Maria Bruno, head of U.S. Wealth Planning Research at Vanguard, which administers retirement plans for nearly five million participants.

How do you plan to adjust contributions to your retirement accounts after the new limits kick in? Join the conversation below.

In Vanguard’s retirement savings plans during 2021, 14% of participants saved the maximum amount of $19,500 ($26,000 for those age 50 or older). Six in 10 participants with income of more than $150,000 made catch-up contributions.

Thirty-seven percent of households owning traditional IRAs or Roth IRAs in mid-2021 made contributions in tax year 2020, according to the Investment Company Institute. The median contribution amount was $5,000.

The inflation adjustments also apply to the income thresholds that determine whether taxpayers can deduct IRA contributions on their income tax returns and whether taxpayers can contribute to a Roth IRA.

In 2023, the deduction for taxpayers making contributions to a traditional IRA is phased out for singles and heads of household who are covered by a workplace retirement plan and have modified adjusted gross incomes between $73,000 and $83,000, up from between $68,000 and $78,000 this year. For married couples filing jointly, in which the spouse who makes the IRA contribution is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the deduction is phased out for taxpayers with income between $116,00 to $136,000 for 2023, up from between $109,000 to $129,000 this year.

For a saver who is not covered by a workplace retirement plan and is married to someone who is covered, the deduction for traditional IRA contributions is phased out if the couple’s income is between $218,000 and $228,000 in 2023, up from between $204,000 and $214,000 this year.

For Roth IRAs, where the money you contribute is after tax, eligibility to contribute is based on your income. Once you are in a certain income range, the amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA is reduced, until you reach the income level where contributions are no longer allowed.

In 2023, the Roth IRA income range where eligibility phases out is between $218,000 and $228,000 for married couples filing jointly, up from between $204,000 and $214,000 this year. For singles and heads of household, the income range is between $138,000 and $153,000 in 2023, up from between $129,000 and $144,000 this year.

If you earn too much to get a deduction for contributing to an IRA, you can still contribute—it just won’t lower your tax bill.

If you earn too much to open a Roth IRA, you can open a nondeductible IRA and convert it to a Roth IRA in a move known as a backdoor Roth IRA.

The adjustments are designed to keep your retirement savings on pace with inflation. “If investors can increase their contributions, that money has the power to compound immensely over time,” says Ms. Bruno

1. Fear of the future insolvency. If someone who owes you money decides to borrow a huge amount of money you will become less certain about the prospect of this someone actually giving you your money back in the future.
2. Fear of the further inflation. When the government decides to borrow there are always fears of the Central bank monetizing the debt in one form or the other (for example, to prevent the rise of the interest rates, as BoE literally just did). Thus, you'd want a higher return which can protect you from inflation and which bonds that you currently hold can’t provide.
3. If the government promises to substantially increase the supply of bonds in the future, it's safe to assume that bond prices will fall in the future. Thus, if you are in the business of trading bonds, you will definitely want to get rid of your bonds while prices are still high.

All of that sparked an initial sell off that then motivated pension funds to sell bonds which exacerbated the crisis.

Basically I'm wondering why it's so cheap. My guess is the following:

* Pullback in Chinese stocks
* Pullback in US investment sentiment
* Covid lockdowns hurting economy
* Small decrease in revenue compared to 2021 (what else is new)
* Delisting risk

Apart from that I can't really explain the extremely low stock price. This is even deeper than BABA and others, and deeper than most of the US market. Look at the positives:

* Grown earnings 13% annually for the last 10 years
* Has $551 million in cash with only $925 million in market cap ($8/share in cash compared to $13.78 stock price)
* Has a laughably small 14 million in debt, which was probably just done to get an S&amp;P credit rating
* BBB- credit rating
* Wealth and Asset Management revenue streams are reasonably diversified
* Selling at 0.71x book value
* Offering a 2.2% dividend next year
* Earnings growth expected at \~14% and \~9% for 2023 and 2024 respectively
* FWD PE of 4.32
* 10-year PE of 15.6
* Applied for dual listing in Hong Kong to mitigate delisting risk, which means Chinese investors can buy the stock directly soon
* Has excellent runway as millionaires in China double over the next 5 years (7x faster than the US)

Any thoughts? My thinking on the delisting risk, since that is what will worry people the most, is that in the extremely unlikely event it gets delisted (it has something like three years to rectify its books), it will still trade on the Hong Kong stock exchange where it has access to capital/investors there, and otherwise in the States it'll trade OTC (over the counter).

I like think - where is this company going to be in the next ten years, or say, by 2030? It's the largest independent wealth and asset manager in china. It has 4% of the TOTAL market share (including banks) and 22% of the independent wealth and asset advisor market share. If I were to pick the best metrics for a company, it would have a ton of cash, no debt, growing earnings and revenue well, be selling under book value and deeply undervalued compared to its long term PE, and be in a growing industry.

t3_y97nio|1666294539.0|investing|Trying to understand yield on specific bonds|"I'm trying to figure out the best bonds to purchase to park my excess capital for short term.  I'm sitting on quite a bit of cash, I do DCA about twice a month but in smaller chunks and at the rate I'm going, it'll be a while before I'm fully invested (if I ever even get to that point).  So in the meantime, I'm looking at parking my excess capitol into short term bonds, probably the 1-3 month range, and plan to keep rolling that.  

Anyhow, I'm having a hard time understanding the true yield for return since there are so many metrics \[yield to worst, yield to maturity, coupon rate, etc.\].  From my understanding, the coupon rate would be the interest rate paid at specific intervals.....however some of these bonds have 0% coupon rates, so I'm not understanding where the yield would come from.  Those same 0% coupon rate bills show a lets say 2.8% yield to maturity.  So my assumption would be that if I hold that bill to maturity, I should net 2.8% right? But then what is the purpose of the yield to worst? And then there's the offer price which the bill is bought at.  If I pay under the $100 which bills try to aim for (lets say $98.9), I understand I'm buying at a discount, but does that mean when the bill matures, I am paid out the principal amount at $100 and pocketing the difference?  

My broker has a fixed income calculator, which allows you to enter the CUSIP# and it tells you what your expected profit is.  But on these 0% coupon rate bills, it actually shows me losing money (due to fees) and not gaining any returns.  I mean what's the point of even buying that bill if that's the case, something either seems off about that or I'm not understanding it properly."|0.9|72.0|0.0|72.0

t3_y9741y|1666293232.0|investing|Atkore Inc. ($ATKR) An attractive prospect for the future of Green Energy and Infrastructure|"Hi everyone! I wrote some DD on Atkore Inc. together with [u/captnamurica2](https://www.reddit.com/u/captnamurica2/)

**Intro**

* Atkore is a leading manufacturer of electrical products and safety products. Their product lines include electrical power systems, conduit, cable, installation accessories, metal framing, mechanical pipe, and perimeter security.
* Atkore holds leading positions within the market. Most of their products are number 1 or 2 in their specific business.
* Atkore supports its long-term growth by aggressively acquiring businesses, which helps with further product diversification.
* Atkore has a strong economic moat
* Continued investment in electrification of infrastructure and an increase in renewable energy infrastructure will benefit ATKR significantly.

**The Numbers**

* ATKR has a decent revenue 3-year annual growth rate of 15.2%.
* ATKR has an impressive ROIC of 95%, indicating that each $100 invested in the business results in an additional $95 of operating income.
* ATKR has an impressive gross margin of 41%, indicating that it has strong pricing power.
* ATKR has a solid FCF of 12.89%, which indicates that the company could buy itself back in about 8 years.
* Forward PE: At the current valuation ATKR has a forward PE of 4.19.

**Split up into two segments:**

In 2021 they split their company into two segments to focus on growing the value of each segment individually and have kept with that model since.

* **Electrical Segment:** Metal electrical conduit and fittings, plastic pipe and conduit, electrical cable and flexible conduit, and international cable management systems, which are critical components of the electrical infrastructure for new construction and maintenance, MR&amp;R markets  

   * **Competitors in this segment**: ABB Ltd., Eaton Corporation plc, nVent Electric plc, Hubbell Incorporated, Zekelman Industries, Inc., Nucor Corporation, Southwire Company, LLC, and Encore Wire Corporation plc
* **Safety and Infrastructure Segment:** Mechanical pipe, metal framing and fittings, and perimeter security. Their metal framing products are used in the installation of electrical systems and various support structures, and their mechanical tube products can commonly be found in solar applications  

   * **Competitors in this segment:** Zekelman Industries Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, ABB Ltd. and Haydon Corporation

**Foreign Exchange Risk and Customer Diversification**

Due to the massive changes in foreign exchange rates over the past couple of years, we figured it would be on your mind how vulnerable this stock is to changes in these rates. Currently, this is more important than ever in a time when Morgan Stanley estimates at least 10% earnings decline in the S&amp;P 500 due to exchange rate issues.

Furthermore, Atkore had an average of 89% customer concentration in the United States in the 2019-2021, which indicates that there isn’t much foreign exchange risk. Unfortunately, there is still some risk involved. Especially due to the dollars havoc on the global economy. Almost every single foreign buyer that Atkore deals with has currency that has sunk against the dollar. In addition, on the foreign exchange front, all suppliers are in North America, as well as most manufacturing is done in the US. Taking all of this in consideration, there is more than likely no foreign exchange advantage to this business, and possibly minor impact due to a small part of sales being dealt in other currencies.

**Strategies and Economic Headwinds**

According to their 2021 annual report (2022 ends this quarter so expect another annual report soon), they live and die by nonresidential construction. This also means that they live and die basically by United States GDP.

Now we might not be geniuses but, those 2 things sound like they are literally right around the corner so it sounds like Atkore might be up the creek without a paddle. The good news for us is, and let’s take a second look at that segments list again and we see that we are looking at a company who specializes in infrastructure, more specific, electric infrastructure. Now, this sounds like something very similar to the “Inflation Reduction Act”, which has specific plans for electric infrastructure (how else are we supposed to support all those EVs that we can’t support). This is where we get some lucky news!

Check out these comments from CEO Bill Waltz on the Q3 conference call:

""Yeah, it's definitely a great question, Victor. The infrastructure bill is going to absolutely help. I forgot the exact number, but I want to say there's $50 million, $60 billion of the $ 1.2-year marking exactly to putting fiber optical lines in across the country.

So as mentioned earlier, we've had outside consultants look at it and estimate the current capacity of the industry and how much should be needed over the next five to seven years to meet demand just of the infrastructure bill itself and it is very promising""

Now, this isn’t the clearest transcript of all time, but it sounds like our market leader in electric infrastructure and specifically fiber optic lines will have a great chance to capitalize on this “free money”. Furthermore, there is plenty of renewable energy infrastructure planning, which will lead to more spending in areas that they can capitalize on. In addition, this might stabilize some of the volume reduction and margin compression that should be expected leading into the future. The company stated in its Q3 report that they expect EBITDA to decline from $1200-$1300 for 2022 to $800-$900 for 2023. Clearly, management expects higher than that.

**Valuation**

Atkore originally popped up on our radar around the end of September (when it was in its early $70 range) and we just didn’t take the time to look into it until now, almost a month later, and boy was it a costly month. Meanwhile, the stock has ballooned close to 25%. As a market leader and decent margin candidate, we believe that it’s a pretty safe assumption (especially with the current management's ability to allocate capital) to give a longer-than-usual time horizon with a decent amount of growth. We also took a look at the normalized earnings to accommodate for an expected margin crunch. This would give them a 2023 EBIT of around $450 million (this is a safe estimate). By normalizing their earnings and giving them a slightly above-average growth rate. This can be justified due to a further increase in expected demand over the decade.

In addition, the company has a great management team. We believe a multiple around 12-15 is reasonable. Furthermore, their stock buybacks for the rest of the year will likely reduce the share amount to 41.5 million shares. This gives an approximate intrinsic value of around $120-$131/s. We believe this to be a relatively conservative estimate but at the current share price it isn’t a 100-bagger by any means we believe this to be a fairly decent investment deserving of a much higher-than-normal multiple.

**Capital Allocation and Management**

Atkore’s management has performed impeccably over the last 3 years. This is shown in their income statement over the last 3 years as well as a booming balance sheet due to a restructuring of loans in 2021 due to low interest rates and beautiful M&amp;A allocation that is already paying for itself.

ROIC for 2021 and 2020 respectively was 95% and 46% (no small feat). In addition, a 10% increase in EBITDA from IPO (which was in 2016) until covid. Safe to say that this management and Bill Waltz know exactly what they’re doing, and we haven’t even gotten to the best news yet. There has been $500 million worth of share buybacks and we expect this to continue in the future. Furthermore, they plan to do over $1 billion in acquisitions ($250 million thus far) and share buybacks (over 25% of their current market cap!). In our opinion, this sounds like a very exciting opportunity for a company that currently has a market cap of $3.76B.

“Mr. Waltz has served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Atkore since 2018. Prior to that, he served in several other Company executive roles, including Chief Operating Officer and Group President of its electrical business. From 2009 until joining Atkore in 2013, Mr. Waltz was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Strategic Materials, Inc., North America’s largest glass recycling company.

Mr. Johnson joined Atkore in August 2018 with more than 29 years’ of experience in strategic and financial planning, risk assessment, mergers &amp; acquisitions, global tax strategies, international operations, and internal controls. Most recently, Mr. Johnson was Vice President-Finance &amp; Operations for the Electrical Sector business at Eaton Corporation, where he was responsible for sector financial planning, analysis, and reporting; compliance, credit &amp; collections, government accounting as well as global purchasing, manufacturing strategies, logistics and distribution.”

**Insider Purchases**

Unfortunately, there haven’t been any insider purchases recently. We would like to see some insider action as this would further strengthen our thesis. As we know, insiders can sell for many reasons, but they only buy stock for one reason.

**The Charts**

ATKR currently has a YTD bottom of around $70.52. This is an important support to watch. If the market continues to deteriorate, we could see the price drop below this level. This would mean more downside is possible.

We can see the stock is falling together with the market as it is currently down close to 30% since its ATH in June of this year, which is similar to the SPX. Currently, we are fighting the $89 resistance, which is getting rejected. Ideally, we would like to see the stock stay above the crucial $70.52 support. We believe the stock provides a very enticing opportunity around that $70 support level.

Now let’s have a look at the long-term chart. We can clearly see the stock is having a rough time. The stock has fallen close to 30% since its all-time high, as we mentioned above. As the company only IPO’d in 2016, we don’t have that much technical data yet.

Atkore does have a strong business as we discussed in this article. Atkore is well-positioned in an industry, which will continue to grow in the future. Furthermore, the share buybacks will provide a cushion for the stock price in the next year. Although, the company will certainly struggle due to current macroeconomic headwinds, we believe this company is one to keep an eye on for the long term. We would like the stock to break above the current $89 resistance level, which has proven to be a tough nut to crack. If we break above, the $99 level seems likely.

**Conclusion**

We believe Atkore Inc. is a must-watch if it declines further as we believe this company is well-positioned to gain tremendously from further investments in infrastructure and green energy in the upcoming years.

We believe the share buybacks and further acquisitions will provide the stock price with a nice safety cushion. In addition, if management is able to continue their performance of the past, we believe ATKR is a rather safe investment with a lot of growth ahead.

I would love to hear some opinions on this DD.

I always thought they set some target/range/limit, but if that's true, they don't really control the yield

The thought goes something like this:

Say newly issued treasury has 4.5% coupon, then that is used to price an older bond that has say a 2% coupon, making it trade at a discount using 4.5% as the discount rate. Not sure if correct, but that's how I make sense of it.

But to an investor pricing a 2% coupon bond, they won't necessarily use that 4.5% as the discount rate, it just depends on what alternative risk-free return they can actually obtain. If bonds are unlimited, then yes use 4.5%, but that contradicts with my understanding that there's a limit to bond issuance. If bonds are limited, then it's the market that determines what a 4.5% coupon bond should be priced.

To put the question to an extreme example, suppose the gov issues only 1 x $1000 20-year bond, with a coupon of 30%. Would investors just start using 20% discount rate for all bonds all of a sudden?"|0.71|9.0|0.0|9.0

t3_y78ncc|1666103436.0|investing|I did a deep dive into the science behind Vertex Pharmaceutical's new drug CTX001|"tl;dr CTX001 has some major unexpected upside, if it gets approval it can be used to treat basically any hemoglobin-based disease because it allows the body to produce fetal hemoglobin instead.  It also has a little bit of overhype though as their CRISPR platform cannot be used to deliver non-blood related therapies.  You can remove someone's blood and give it back to them but you can't do it with their muscles (if you wanted to treat [Duschenne muscular dystrophy for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy)).   This could be a big step forward in blood diseases, but it isn't going to help us bring CRISPR tech to other parts of the body besides the blood.

  

Vertex has a drug called CTX001 which has been in the news as it seeks FDA approval to treat sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia.  Sickle cell anemia happens when the hemoglobin in your blood has a mutation that makes it fold into the wrong shape, this makes red blood cells become sickle shaped instead of their usual donut shape, and these sickle-shaped red blood cells get caught in the tiny capillaries of your body.  This causes damage and a lack of energy as blood isn’t able to efficiently transfer nutrients and waste into and out of your cells.  Sickle cell anemia reduces one’s life expectancy to around 40-60 years.  Beta thalassemia is another hemoglobin disease this time caused by reduced production of hemoglobin itself.  Less hemoglobin means less nutrients and waste can be transferred by the blood, meaning the body can’t work as efficiently.  Beta thalassemia in its major form has a life expectancy of around 20-30 years.  

Despite the fact that both diseases are caused by mutations in hemoglobin, the mutations are very different from each other and so it surprised me that both were being treated by a single CRISPR drug.  How CRISPR works is that a protein uses a piece of nucleic acid to very specifically target itself towards an area on a gene of interest.  The protein can then cut into that gene of interest and if another piece of nucleic acid is on the protein, then that other piece of nucleic acid can be incorporated into the gene by the cell’s nucleic acid repair machinery.  This process is somewhat random in nature, it’s hard to ensure that your other piece of nucleic acid gets incorporated and even harder to ensure that it is incorporated in just the right orientation, just the right position, and just the right way so as not to cause problems down the line.  Since sickle cell and beta thalassemia are caused by mutations in very different places within the hemoglobin gene, a CRISPR drug that is targeted towards the sickle cell mutation site should not be able to also hit the beta thalassemia mutation site.

But the trick is that CTX001 isn’t targeting hemoglobin, it’s targeting *fetal hemoglobin*.  When a baby is in the womb, it needs to take oxygen from its mother’s blood stream to survive.  If a baby’s hemoglobin were the same as its mother’s, this process would be inefficient because both the baby’s and mother’s hemoglobin would bind to the oxygen equally well and there would not be enough oxygen flowing from the mother’s blood into the baby’s.  It would be like a tug of war where both sides are of equal strength.  However, fetal hemoglobin binds to oxygen more strongly than adult hemoglobin, and this ensures that a baby can take the oxygen it needs from its mother’s blood stream.  Fetal hemoglobin usually stops being produced around the time the baby is born, and after the body switches over to purely adult hemoglobin by around 6-months after birth.  What CTX001 does is it tries to switch on the production of fetal hemoglobin in people suffering from sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia.  If they can produce fetal hemoglobin instead then it can compensate for the fact that their normal hemoglobin isn’t working properly, and should reduce their symptoms and prolong their lives.

How CTX001 does this is by altering the promotion of the fetal hemoglobin gene.  The promoter regions of genes are the segments of a gene that help the gene get transcribed into new mRNA.  That mRNA will then get translated into a new protein.  The promoter of fetal hemoglobin does not usually allow the gene to get transcribed into adulthood, so no fetal hemoglobin gets made.  But altering the promotion of the gene would allow it to be transcribed, and thus translated, and so fetal hemoglobin would be produced in the body.  Now here’s where it gets a bit tricky: they aren’t actually altering the promoter region of fetal hemoglobin, but rather the promoter region of another gene called BCL11A.  I wanted to explain how promoters work, but there’s more to explain now because biology is complicated so bear with me:

The reason the promoter region of fetal hemoglobin doesn’t normally allow transcription (and thus production of the gene) is because of a *repressor* called BCL11A.  BCL11A is a protein that sits on the promoter of fetal hemoglobin and refuses to budge, this prevents any other protein from accessing the fetal hemoglobin gene and thus prevents fetal hemoglobin from being transcribed.  Now BCL11A is produced by its own gene, and CTX001 alters the promoter region of BCL11A in such a way that no BCL11A can be produced.  Without BCL11A, there is nothing to repress the promotion of fetal hemoglobin.  Without the repression of fetal hemoglobin, its promoter region is accessible and it can be transcribed.  With the transcription of fetal hemoglobin, the fetal hemoglobin protein will be produced in the body.  And with the production of fetal hemoglobin, the diseases caused by malformed adult hemoglobin (sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia) should be reduced.

But it’s still not over!  How the hell would CTX001 find every red blood cell in the body and do its thing?  It doesn’t have to!  Hematopoietic stem cells are the stem cells which produce red blood cells (and it’s red blood cells which will carry the hemoglobin or fetal hemoglobin in the blood).  Hematopoietic stem cells can be extracted from the patient’s blood and then altered with CTX001 so that they will produce fetal hemoglobin.  The cells which are successfully altered can then be transferred back into the patient.  Before the altered cells are given back to the patient, the patient is given busulfan to kill off stem cells.  This is necessary to kill off some of the stem cells which are producing the malformed hemoglobin so that the new stem cells producing fetal hemoglobin can reproduce and become the majority.  The patient is then monitored for improvements in their sickle cell anemia or beta thalassemia condition.

So this process is long, involved and complicated.  Just to list all the things that could go wrong: when altering the promoter the nucleic acid could accidentally be mutated towards being cancerous, killing of so many stem cells using busulfan could have harsh side effects, the infused hematopoietic stem cells might not reproduce and become the majority, and even then the nucleic acid of the promoter might not be altered enough so that fetal hemoglobin becomes the majority of the hemoglobin in the body.  But I’m sure every step is heavily monitored by Vertex during the treatment process."|0.71|6.0|0.0|6.0

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG has approached at least one Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund for a capital injection, a source said, while some funds are looking at the scandal-hit Swiss bank's businesses as potential investment opportunities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia were weighing up, through their sovereign wealth funds, whether to put money into Credit Suisse's investment bank and other businesses, Bloomberg reported. An investment would be to take advantage of low valuations, it said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Credit Suisse's investment banking chief, Christian Meissner, will be [**leaving the bank**](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisses-meissner-leave-bank-after-overhaul-source-says-2022-10-17/) once it has announced a strategic overhaul on Oct. 27, a source familiar with the situation said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The size and other details of a potential capital injection could not be learned.  
&gt;  
&gt;A spokesperson for Credit Suisse declined to comment, reiterating that it will update on its strategy review when it announces third-quarter earnings.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The largest Middle Eastern sovereign fund investor in Credit Suisse, the Qatar Investment Authority, declined to comment. Mubadala declined to comment. ADIA and PIF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Credit Suisse's U.S.-listed depository receipts closed 3.6% higher on Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt; Credit Suisse, one of the largest banks in Europe, is trying to recover from a string of scandals, including losing more than $5 billion from the collapse of investment firm Archegos last year, when it also had to suspend client funds linked to failed financier Greensill.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Analysts have said the [**company might need**](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-approached-middle-eastern-fund-capital-injection-source-2022-10-17/) as much as 9 billion Swiss francs ($9 billion) as part of a reorganization, some of which may have to come from investors and some from the sale of assets.  
&gt;  
&gt;It has already begun a sale process for its U.S. asset management arm, with initial bids due at the end of this week, a source familiar with the matter said. Bloomberg News, which first reported the news on Monday, said the unit is expected to draw interest from private equity firms. [**read more**](https://www.reuters.com/business/credit-suisse-starts-sale-us-asset-management-arm-bloomberg-news-2022-10-17/)  
&gt;  
&gt;Its approach for a capital raise indicates that the sale of assets alone may not be enough to cover the costs of an imminent overhaul that the embattled bank hopes will draw a line under heavy losses and a string of scandals.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Monday, the Swiss lender agreed to pay $495 million to settle legal action over mortgage-linked investments in the United States, adding to the billions it has been paying out to resolve legal cases linked to its residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) business in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;The New Jersey case was the largest of its [**remaining exposure**](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-pays-495-million-settle-legacy-case-2022-10-17/) on its legacy RMBS business, Credit Suisse said, with five remaining cases, all far smaller, still in litigation.  
&gt;  
&gt;In June, Credit Suisse was convicted of failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang, while a Bermuda court ruled that a former Georgian prime minister and his family were due damages of more than half a billion dollars from Credit Suisse's local life insurance arm.  
&gt;  
&gt;Credit Suisse's chairman, Axel Lehmann, pledged on Friday to [**reform the bank**](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-chairman-pledges-reform-after-horrible-year-2022-10-14/) after a ""horrible"" 2021 in which it lost billions of dollars, the biggest ever loss in its history.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We are fully aware that we need to change and we will change, clearly,"" he said.

&gt;Lehmann took over in January at the Swiss bank."|0.96|444.0|0.0|444.0

The fund is appropriate for investors seeking long-term income. JEPI is subject to equity market risk, and risk that its security selection process underperforms the broader market. Additionally, the options exposure of the equity-linked notes provides income, but limits the upside potential of the fund relative to the US stock market, and exposes investors to counterparty risk.

I know the M2V is the speed at which money transfers for goods and services. One would think that in a high inflationary environment like we’re in right now that the M2V would be incredibly high. The thing is though, it’s not, it’s actually the lowest it has ever been since 1931 (that was a bad year if I recall correctly \*sarcasm\*).

On top of that it looks like the M2 itself has peaked and isn’t increasing anymore. These are two signs that inflation, while it may seem sticky, is likely to come down fairly quickly in my opinion and if my understanding on the matter is even remotely accurate.

I understand that a lot of what is holding inflation up is real estate and more specifically real estate rent prices which are generally laggers. That makes up something ridiculous like 30% of the CPI data and rent prices and rents being paid probably don’t contribute much to M2V (may be wrong on that), but that would maybe explain why the M2V isn’t higher than it is right now.

Anyway, the M2 and M2V really appear to be signaling that the American consumer is topped out in what they have for cash on hand and how much they’re actually using that cash for goods and services. This would, at least on paper, signal a top in inflation no?

t3_y6lg6b|1666037905.0|investing|Market Crises are like Brain Seizures|"Dror Kennett, a 31 year old physicist (at the time) was involved in a unique study that focused on the analysis and modeling of financial systems. He works within the area of ""econophysics""-- a unique field of physics that applies concepts developed by physicists to solve economic problems. 

Findings from the study show that the connected way that financial markets behave during a market crisis is similar to the behavior of a brain during epileptic fits. Dr Kennett explains: ""you can think of different regions of the brain as different economic markets. Each region has it's own dynamic and behavior. Yet once a brain seizure starts, all the regions start acting together--just as when there is a crash in the markets."" 

He says that in epilepsy, one part of the brain takes over and interferes with normal brain activity. I've read that during market crises, all correlations go to 1, meaning all asset classes move down in tandem. The brain, similarly, falls under one single focus of correlation. ""And this is what we see in the markets; when the markets start to go down, the correlations between the different stocks and companies become stronger and stronger, keeping this downward momentum going.""

In response to the GFC, he said ""The excessive dominance of the financial sector distorted healthy activity in other sectors leading to 'market stiffness'. This 'market stiffness' was demonstrated in the emergence of 'market seizure' behavior. In epilepsy, there is the over-dominance of the epileptic focus on the functioning of all other regions of the brain.""

Dr Kennett believes that a new way of analyzing financial systems is needed to prevent economic crises moving forward. ""Economics as a science is mainly driven by theories, and much of the economic theories are based on the physics of 100 years ago, particularly the notion of equilibrium. But physics has really evolved over the past 100 years--and systems are not always in equilibrium.""

Have markets always behaved this way during crises? Or did crises use to be more compartmentalized? 

Credit securitization has minimized the risk of individual credit and widened the availability of funding. But will the resulting financial market interconnectedness turn every crisis into a systemic one with global implications?"|0.35|0.0|0.0|0.0

My thesis is buying in small portions every time interest rates goes higher (I suspect they will untill q1 23), then try to buy a bit more when rates start to fall. If inflation expectations and long rates fall from 5 to say around 2, we should see a large (and very safe) upswing in the value of tlt and other long-term bonds (funds). This tactic I've been practicing in the game WSR, and it's immensely effective and profitable, (if you have the time horizon and the funds for it).

However, there's one thing about this ETF I don't get, and that's the yield. I see from the official long bond rates that they are at around 4%, yet this fund yields only 2% (?). What exactly does that mean...will the yield catch up as the etf rolls over its positions?

I have done a lot of looking online but am still a bit stuck on some aspects of synthetic CDOs and credit default swaps. **My understanding is this:**


*Synthetic CDOs are made up of swaps that ""insure"" against the bonds in a CDO defaulting. As long as the payments are made by the swap holders, the synthetic CDO investors will see returns. These mortgage payments are (seemingly) guaranteed to keep coming, so it's basically free money for the banks issuing swaps and people investing in the synthetic CDOs. However, if people do default on their mortgages and other loans, the swap holders get paid out by whoever sold their swaps to them and the synthetic CDO investors get burned.* 

*Leading up to the GFC, the synthetic CDO market had grown significantly larger than the actual CDO and MBS market it was synthesized from. When people started defaulting on their payments, the banks weren't in a position to pay out what was owed to the swap holders, and bankruptcies ensued.*


If my understanding is correct, I have a couple questions:

1. For there to be so much investment in synthetic CDOs there must have also been a proportionally high amount of people or organizations buying swaps and speculating that the market would collapse, right? Who was buying these swaps?

2. When the collapse came, did all these people buying swaps win out? Did they all manage to come out relatively on top, or was it mostly the people who offloaded their swaps before the investment banks went under?

3. (Less directly related) In theory, could a regular CDO be a sensible mechanism for investment assuming that the ratings were correct? It seems pretty sensible to me if done with the best understanding of risk.


If I am completely off base about anything, I would appreciate it if someone could tell me where.

Countries will force more localization due to national security risks. Energy prices will remain high. China will stick to its zero-covid policy. Rising rates will reduce demand and make credit more expensive. Reduced demand will hurt the economies of scale. Expensive credit will make ongoing investments more expensive to complete. Prices will keep going up for a few years, until these factors are mitigated. The market bottom will be when the companies cancel stock buybacks and start printing shares.

# Long read

The prevailing narrative today is that central banks will keep raising interest rates and sucking money out of the economy by other means, which will tame inflation sometime soon in 2023 due to reduced demand and economic slowdown. This is what the financial markets are pricing in, judging by bets on rates and bonds.

However, the global inflation we are experiencing today is not driven purely by monetary policies. That’s why inflation is global, spanning the whole world, even though different countries have vastly different monetary policies.

There are pockets of inflation, which are global, and were caused by relentless money printers, like real estate, travel, luxury goods, crypto, and various other assets. This is where the largest price reductions will continue. If you have any type of asset, it’s safe to say it will depreciate even more. Declines in housing and rent will drive down inflation metrics across the world, helping the central banks get closer to their inflation targets.

But the central banks cannot meet their 2% goals, because they cannot mitigate other factors causing global inflation. These are supply chain issues, caused first by COVID-19, then strict China zero-covid policies, then Russian invasion of Ukraine. We have an energy and food crises on top of that, also caused by the war in Ukraine. There’s nothing central banks can do about restructuring of supply chains, food scarcity, and energy shortage. They won’t be able to meet their inflation targets anytime soon and will have to keep higher rates in place for a few years.

# Just-in-time vs Redundancy

Up until COVID-19, just-in-time production was *the way* of manufacturing. Whoever was more efficient at doing this was winning the profits race. The approach first pioneered by Toyota eventually was applied across the global economy. Until the priorities changed.

First, the pandemic exacerbated problems of this model. Companies suddenly became unable to get the parts needed anymore and were dependent on various government policies regulating lockdowns. Production of everything, from bicycles to cars, was disrupted, often delayed by a single missing part. For example, Ford currently delays production of its most lucrative F-150 trucks, because its single supplier of company badges and logos is in trouble.

[Ford’s Latest Supply-Chain Problem: a Shortage of Blue Oval Badges](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fords-latest-supply-chain-snarl-not-enough-blue-oval-badges-11663944141)

Second, there was a strong belief that global trade and mutual benefits would prevent countries from starting large scale conflicts, because it would devastate the quality of life of everyone involved and beyond. This belief was shattered after Russia started a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the governments across the world are scared, and want to mitigate their national security risks. This includes everything, from food, to energy, to semiconductors, to commodities, etc.

Combined, this led to manufacturing being restructured from just-in-time into a redundancy model. Companies want to secure their own exclusive supply chains and have back-up options. Countries want to have localized manufacturing of various goods to mitigate national security risks.

The pandemic and the war are not the only factors they fear. Whether it’s an earthquake in Taiwan or a blockade from China, it’s the same risk to have all your chips manufactured there. The risks were always present but became much more prominent in a short period of time.

Coming back to Ford, and car manufacturers in general. They will have to source materials and produce the batteries locally to qualify for EV subsidies. This is a massive undertaking, which requires to build new mines, factories and duplicate numerous other elements of EV supply chain.

Restructuring of supply chains is a very expensive process on its own. This will keep driving prices higher over the next few years, until we see the first benefits coming to fruition. The prices won’t go down after that either because redundancy is more expensive. Combined with higher cost for local wages, more expensive locally sourced materials, higher environmental standards, etc., this will stick prices to a higher level. We are years away from reaching those levels.

# Micron case

Let’s have a detailed look at a specific company to highlight the trend. Micron is not unique in what it’s doing, but perfectly illustrates what the companies around the world are going through.

Micron is a great company. It has valuable, high margin, industry leading products. It has been around forever and will outlive all of you reading this text.

However, its stock is down roughly 50% and may as well lose another 50% until we reach the bottom. Why is that?

First, they need to invest a lot in local manufacturing in the US. They do not have an option of not doing this. And we are talking about $150 billion over the next decade.

[Micron to spend up to $100 billion to build a computer chip factory in New York](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/micron-to-spend-up-to-100-billion-to-build-new-york-chip-plant.html)

[Micron breaks ground on $15 billion U.S. chip plant, says more to come soon](https://www.reuters.com/technology/micron-breaks-ground-15-bln-us-chip-plant-says-more-come-soon-2022-09-12/)

[Micron Announces Over $150 Billion in Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D Investments](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-over-150-billion-global-manufacturing-and-rd)

The company also must diversify its supply chains. For example, Ukraine used to supply 70% of neon gases used in semiconductors manufacturing. Micron is adding redundancies to avoid bottlenecks like this one in the future.

[Micron has diversified sourcing for its noble gases](https://evertiq.com/design/51415)

It will take years for Micron to see the first benefits of these investments. And many more years for these investments to pay off. At the same time, the PC market is going through the worst slowdown in 20 years, while their current supply chains are still damaged by the war and zero-covid policies in China.

[PC Shipments Plunge Nearly 20%, Steepest Drop in More Than 20 Years](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pc-shipments-plunge-nearly-20-steepest-drop-in-more-than-20-years-11665442764)

How would Micron pay for these investments? Micron does not have $150 billion to invest and will have to find a way to finance this endeavor. It cannot avoid or postpone the investments and would have to drive them to completion no matter the cost.

This is a weird situation, where the central banks are trying their best to reduce inflation, but making mandatory investments like these more expensive, which will drive prices higher, and keep inflation elevated. A conundrum, which is mostly ignored today.

Micron, as well as other global companies, would go through a path, which would force them to raise prices for their products, but still end up indebted, strapped for cash, going through periods of unprofitability, and having their stocks at depressed valuations.

# Buy High, Sell Low

Unfortunately, companies typically purchase a record amount of their stock at peak valuations when they have record profits. Last year the top companies spent their entire yearly profits on stock buybacks (Microsoft, Meta, Google, Nvidia, etc.). They bought the all-time high number of shares at the all-time high prices.

For example, last year Meta spent **$44.8 billion** on buybacks, which is roughly its yearly profit. And Meta spent almost $19 billion on buybacks in the last three months 2021 alone, at the top of the top of its stock price. What this means, is the company made no money last year. They spent all of their profits on buybacks, but the stock fell by 60% anyway.

[Meta Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2022/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Results/default.aspx)

Companies are reluctant to cancel buybacks because this would immediately tank their shares. Instead, they try to reduce costs, freeze hiring, do layoffs, issue debt, postpone investments, and when everything else is off the table, they finally cancel buybacks. And only after that do they reduce dividends.

Cost reduction, freeze hiring, small layoffs, and debt issuance are already ongoing across the US economy and increasing by the day. Investments, which would typically be postponed in this situation, are increasing, and financed through debt. Let's look at Meta again. Even though this company is not affected by supply chain issues, it's also in the process of going through the largest restructuring in its history and betting its future on it. This trend seems to be universal and encompassing even unrelated companies, probably due to record profits last year.

[Meta raises $10 billion in first-ever bond offering](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-raises-10-billion-first-ever-bond-offering-2022-08-09/)

The interest rates are rapidly rising, and it will soon become too expensive to issue more debt. The companies will then tap more into their cash reserves and future profits. At some point, this won’t be enough to cover the expenses and buybacks would have to go. This would crash their already depressed stocks. Then companies would have to go through a period of unprofitability and finance their needs through issuing shares at the very bottom of the market.

It's typical for companies to issue shares at the bottom of the market when they have no other options. For example, they almost unanimously printed shares during the bottom of 2020 pandemic crash. And next time, when stocks are at their most depressed levels, when companies are hammered in the news about their poor financial choices, and start printing shares again to stay afloat, would be a good time to buy in. This would be the bottom of the bottom.

Whether it's Micron, or Meta, or pretty much any other large public company, they all are going through a similar path. The next few years are going to be rough.

# Expensive Transition

This transition could have been easier if China or Russia did not change their constitutions to appease their leaders. But both of them did everything to let their leaders stay in power for life.

China is going to stick to its most damaging policies, because their supreme leader is not allowed to admit mistakes. Whatever choices were made must be the right ones. This means zero-covid policies and frequent lockdowns of hundreds of millions of people will continue. This will keep randomly damaging supply chains of any product imaginable, spiking prices and causing shortages, until redundancies are in place.

Similarly, the supreme leader of Russia can not admit his mistakes and would have to wage the war until the bitter end. Losing the war is the end for him and his inner circle. This will exclude Russia from the global economy for the foreseeable future and continue the energy and food crises.

The central banks will continue their fight against inflation. They know they messed up by printing too much money and inflating every asset price imaginable. They want to restore their credibility and cannot back down from this path, because otherwise there’s a risk of hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is much worse than a recession. But because inflation is partly caused by non-monetary factors, the central banks would make ongoing changes in the economy more expensive and inadvertently force inflation to remain higher than their typical 2% targets.

If the central banks had not printed as much money as they did over the last decade, and kept their interest rates reasonably higher, this would be the perfect time for them to reduce the rates and help companies finance their massive investments. Instead, the central banks will make this process more expensive, which will result in higher prices, and will make it harder to bring inflation below 2%.

The central banks will be able to reduce demand. However, reduced demand won’t always make prices cheaper either, because it will decrease the benefits of the economies of scale.

Consider an industry like travel. If fewer and fewer people can afford to travel, and energy prices remain high due to a shortage, then reduced demand only makes flying more expensive. If there’s not enough people to occupy all the seats in an airplane, then each ticket becomes more expensive. The economies of scale benefit from high utilization, once demand goes down, profitability is reduced everywhere, from cloud services to food delivery."|0.78|710.0|0.0|710.0

So I invested in 2020, with BRDY (Dry Bulk Shipping) close to the bottom as everything was frozen with COVID, and sold most of it when it went up when shipping was blocked and overloaded.

I got a nice profit. No complaint here.

So I have some short-term/long-term gains on the position, but when I (finally) received my K1, I also am getting some 1256 contracts and straddles for BDRY. My understanding is that it's marked to market at the end of the year. Now, for 1256, 60% is marked as long-term, and 40% is marked as short-term.

So I feel like I am getting double taxed here.

I am getting taxed on the profit and on the 1256 contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an example of what I mean:

June 1s, 2020. Say I buy some BDRY shares for $100.

December 31, 2020. These shares are now worth $200. So marked to market increase by $100. ($60 long-term, $40 short-term).

May 1st, 2021. I am selling my BDRY shares for $250.

&amp;#x200B;

Tax:

\* $250 - $100 = $150 short term for the profit (OK)

\* And plus, $60 LT, and $40 ST for the 1256 contracts.

So it's as if I am taxed on $190 ST + $60 LT while only having $150 profit.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have experience with that?

Do I just tell my CPA to adjust my cost-basis on my initial shares (from $100 to $200) as that's my new basis from the 1256 contracts? Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

It seems if I bought BDRY with options through a synthetic long (short PUT, long call), I would not have to worry about all these shenanigans. (or maybe not :) )."|0.6|1.0|0.0|1.0

Their strength is in the value-added, not the base commodity.

They could be at risk if housing new starts slows down.

They go into more detail, noting that their sales are also exposed to parts of the US that are seeing relative strength--such as the South-east.

Where do they get this view of bonds to be risk-free assets? 

When I look at bonds(in this case US government bonds), I consider them to be safe in regards to having guaranteed/predictable coupon payments at the promised rate. That's how safe they are IMO. But isn't it widely understood and accepted that they come with duration risk and that could cause market pricing of the bond to be much lower/higher based on fluctuations in the market over the duration of the bond? 


Where are analysts/fund managers getting this viewpoint that they are not supposed to be falling in price and somehow the market pricing of the bonds is also supposed to stay at the price they bought it at? I mean it's fairly obvious to me as a non-bond trader that if I wanted that extra price guarantee(during the life of a bond) &amp; liquidity at the same time then I should be going for a short-term or overnight bond, and if I just want the safest &amp; predictable return from coupon payments then I can buy a long duration bond and hold it to maturity.

Why is the market so surprised that the bond portfolios are down by a lot and somehow they were guaranteed to have mark-to-market price stability if they were going to invest in long duration bonds?

EDIT: Just want to clarify that I am not talking about the risk of bonds from issuer defaulting, but mark-to-market price risk or duration risk that a bond comes with. I am just surprised how many fund managers are saying that conservative investors are in serious losses from draw down in bonds, but that has always been a big risk in long duration bonds, so I am not sure how they are so surprised."|0.66|21.0|0.0|21.0

Is a high deductible plan with a HSA account better than a standard health care plan if you invest the total allowance and leave it in to grow tax-free?

It's open enrollment season again and as a person who invests a percentage of salary each month and who is already maxing existing tax-incentive accounts, I'm wondering if a HDHP with HSA is the best option.

Let's look at the Math for myself and my wife.

**The EPO plan I'm currently on:**  
Coverage: 100%  
Cost per month: $0  
Out of Pocket Max: $5000  
Co-pay: $20/$35

The EPO plan is a no-stress plan, as long as I stay in-network I won't have to pay anything other than the co-pay no matter the cost.

**HDHP + HSA I'm considering:**  
Cost per month: $0  
Deductible: $4000 (90% covered after this)  
Out of Pocket Max: $6000  
HSA Employer Contribution: $2000 + a further $6300 pre-tax contribution from me  
Tax-free savings per annum: $8300  
Tax free savings on $6300 (if taking the marginal rate of 33.4%) is $2087.82Total tax savings + employer contributions: $4087.82

If I choose the HDHP, I'd fund our healthcare outside of the HSA and leave the HSA to be invested and I'd make sure to max the HSA each year.

My wife has an illness that requires her to take medication and go for blood tests/visits at a specialist every 1-2 months, with the current EPO I'd guess we don't spend more than $400 between us in the year, even with these visits. But I'm unsure how much this would cost us with the HDHP plan.

I'd assume that the $4000 I'd have to spend before the insurance would cover 90% would be filled up relatively quickly, but I really have no idea how much the general health care visit would cost.

Looking at some of the worst case scenarios:

**HDHP:**  
$4000 spent in healthcare visits before 90% cover kicks in.$4087.82 earned in tax-free savings and employer contributions  
Net gain: $87.82 + $8300 to grow tax free investments

**EPO:**  
About $500 in co-pay  
Net gain: -$500

If we had a really bad year, or had a baby, I assume even with the 90% covered from $4000-$6000 we'll still have to pay that extra $2000 (can someone confirm this?) If so, this would be the results:

**HDHP:**  
$6000 spent in healthcare visits $4087.82 earned in tax free savings and employer contributions  
Net gain: -$1912.18 + $8300 to grow tax free investments

**EPO:**  
I can't assume it will be much more than $500 in co-pays, that's a lot of doctor visits. But let's add another $200 to be sure, $700.  
Net gain: -$700

The difference with this worst-worst case is **-$1212.18**. Is that worth it for the $8300 tax free invested? How likely is this to even happen? It's such a minefield. I guess another piece of information that needs to be figured out is this: How much is $8300 invested into a HSA worth if it won't be touched over the long-term?

My capital gains rate in the USA is 15%. If $8300 was invested at the 15% capital gains rate, let's say we're lucky and get a 7% return in the stock market over the next 10 years, here are the figures with and without the tax savings:

$16,680 tax free with HSA  
$15,423 in a normal investment account (-$1257)

At 20 years, the tax cut is a lot more prominent at $3783.

Taking the $1257 tax savings over 10 years of growth on the $8300, that adds $125.7 of value onto the HDHP per annum, or $189.15 per annum looking at 20+ year growth. Is this a conservative estimate on the tax-free value of a HSA?

**OK, a round up!**

If we assume these figures are a best case guess, it means that the difference between the EPO and the HDHP from best to worse case for my family is this:

**$2000 spent on health care**  
**HDHP**: +$2213  
**EPO**: -$400  
**Total**: +$2613 saved per annum with the HDHP

**$4000 spent on health care**  
**HDHP**: +$213.52  
**EPO**: -$500  
**Total**: +$713 saved per annum with the HDHP

**$6000 spent on health care**  
**HDHP**: -$1786  
**EPO**: -$700  
**Total**: -$1086 lost per annum with the HDHP

So between **+$2213** and -**$1086** per annum depending on health care needs.

Questions to ponder:

1. How likely is it that we'll go over the $4000 per annum, really? If we had a kid, would we hit the $6000 by paying $2000 in 10% fees?
2. What's the general cost of health care and specialist visits/check ups? Will we be closer to the $2000 or $4000 spend on a HDHP? Anyone got any figures?
3. If we're closer to the $4000 spend, is it even worth all of the effort just to save $713 per year? We'll have a lot more paperwork to deal with and visiting the doctors will be a lot more stressful.

Any advice or critique welcome! I really don't want to leave the HSA on the table because everyone tells me how it's the best investment vehicle and I'm currently investing around $6000 per month into general investment accounts. Although I don't want to do it if it works out worse looking at the hard figures, especially considering the extra paperwork and stress.

The most frustrating part of this is we don't know how much our healthcare costs will be, it feels like it's all a guessing game or roulette wheel spin. Does anyone have similar health care needs on the HDHP plan who can provide some insight?

\------

EDIT: I completely bunged up the figures for how much the invested tax-free HSA money is worth. It didn't make any sense to split the 10 year gain into $125 per month, the money at the end from the initial $8300 is the same. That makes the $8300 invested in the HSA worth $1250 per annum if the plan is to leave it invested for at least 10 years, meaning that in all scenarios, the HDHP works out better. Is this sound logic?"|0.89|103.0|0.0|103.0

While a 1% tax does not amount to much, there are arguments that this could open the door to raising buyback taxes down the line. ""55% of U.S. CFOs surveyed said a hypothetical 2% excise tax on buybacks  would make them rethink how they return cash to stockholders."" We've lived through a thriving buyback landscape, with buybacks becoming the dominant form of corporate payout since 1997. In 1980, 80% of companies had a dividend, while just under 30% engaged in share buybacks. Currently, 40% of companies have a dividend with just over 50% engaging in share buybacks. 

Goldman estimated that their would be ~$1 trillion in share buybacks among S&amp;P constituents throughout full-year 2022. That number looks increasingly unlikely, with Goldman now estimating that number to be $700 billion. If companies begin suspending share buybacks, could we see a shift back to paying dividends as the dominant form of corporate payout? Will certain sectors, such as financials and materials, noted leaders in share buybacks, be adversely affected over sectors with lower net buyback yields?

Assume an isolated economy of:

\-100 people and each individual has $1 (total of $100 with $1/person)

\-There are 100 loafs of bread each one costing $1 (total of $100 worth of loafs of bread)

Next day the population increases by 10x to 1000 people (extreme example but it's just for theory):

\-But the total money in circulation is capped to stay the same at $100 and redistributed equally( $100/1000=$0.1/person)

There is no increase in economic growth either so there's a cap of 100 loafs of bread and their price stays at $1/Loaf of Bread.

&amp;#x200B;

Can this be considered inflation? Technically, there has been **no change in money supply or economic growth which fulfils the criteria for no inflation**. $1 can still buy 1 loaf of bread. It's just no one has $1 dollar anymore (unless they group up in 10s and share 1 loaf of bread 10 parts equal between each other).

With the 2 year treasury at 4.5%, If I buy one directly through my broker, I lock in that rate if I hold to maturity. If bond rates continue to rise, the value of the treasury will go down, and I miss out on a higher rate I would have gotten by waiting… but if I hold to maturity for 2 years I lose no money and make 4.5% for 2 years… OK… I can live with that.

On the other hand, if inflation eases and rates come back down, the value of the treasury goes up and I can sell it for a profit (on top of any interest I have made in the interim), and go back into stocks… will probably miss the early rebound of course… but anyway.. I can live with that too.

t3_y422w5|1665773613.0|investing|(URW:AS) Unibail-Rodamco Westfield likely has 2-3x upside in the medium term|"  

* Unibail’s equity is priced as though the company does not have any terminal value; that is, the market is implying the value of its property portfolio is going to zero in the long term. As of the 30th of June, Unibail’s net asset value was €143 per share. With an equity price of €41 at yesterday’s close, the market is pricing Unibail’s net assets at a 71% discount. 

Unibail owns 82 malls across Europe and the US. At present, they are working through a disposal programme of €4bn of their European portfolio, which they are 80% of the way through. They are also selling their entire portfolio of American shopping centres, which were valued at €13bn at the end of June. As such, there are clear markers communicating to the market that the property portfolio does in fact have value. 

Poor capital allocation over the past few years has cast doubt across the market that management can manage their capital prudently. I believe this to be a key reason for the significant discount. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Unibail is not falling foul to the usual relaxed corporate boards that one tends to come across in Europe. With two high profile activist shareholders on board, Xavier Niel and Leon Bressler, who recently blocked a proposal by the company to issue a fresh €3.5bn in equity, the company is being steered down a path that should result in returns to these activist shareholders, with minorities in tow. 
* The company is heavily indebted with €31bn of debt on its books and a loan to value ratio of 41%. Promisingly, the complete disposal of their portfolio in the US, along with the European disposal programme, is part of a wider strategy put forward by Xavier Niel and Leon Bressler to reduce their debt levels. 

Rising interest rates should not impact Unibail materially with the group’s debt fully hedged for the next five years, along with cash and available securities of €12bn. A 2% increase in rates would only impact Unibail’s recurring earnings by €16.3mn.

&amp;#x200B;

* Unibail is targeting a return to pre-Covid net rental income and group EBITDA by the 2024 financial year. In the 2019 financial year, the company generated net rental income of €2.5bn, suggesting the company is currently trading at just 2.4x its expected 2024 NRI. Positive signs emerged in the first half of the 2022 financial year with net rental income of €912mn, and only a -€187mn movement in the value of their assets, suggesting property valuations have stabilized. 
* The company has announced it will be reinstating its dividend in the 2023 financial year. Assuming a conservative pay-out ratio of 75%, the board may elect to pay a dividend of €7. At the current share price of €41, this would equate to a dividend yield on cost of 16%. If we assign the long-term average dividend yield of 6% that Unibail has traded at over the past seven years, a dividend of €7 per share would equate to a share price of €112.

Higher oil prices = higher core inflation.

Text version:

Inflation is slowing, but how much is it slowing?

That’s the big question facing policy makers, investors and consumers.

Unfortunately, the way we talk about the inflation numbers — released Thursday — can confuse as much as it can clarify. If we focus our attention on how much inflation we’ve already endured, we may miss clues about how much inflation we have yet to endure, which is the most important question.

Instead of concentrating on the here and now, most reports put the year-on-year inflation rate in the headline.

Not to pick on anyone, but here’s how The New York Times reported Thursday’s report on the consumer price index: “Consumer prices rose 8.2 percent in the year through September, in a report that dashes hopes that inflation in the U.S. may be slowing down.”

That’s not wrong, but it’s seriously misleading. I’ll show you a more useful way to think about the numbers.

Making sense of economic data is often a matter of finding the right context, which means the first thing you should do is ask yourself how you want to make use of the data. There are several correct ways of displaying the data, but some are better than others at answering specific questions.

What’s inflation done over the longer run?
For instance, if we want to know how much inflation we’ve already endured, it might be best to look at the year-on-year increase in the CPI. (The same logic in this column applies to the Fed’s preferred measure, the personal consumption expenditure price index.) We would compare current prices with prices a year earlier. This may be the most common way the CPI is reported in the media right now, because it puts the intensity and persistence of inflation into a perspective that readers can relate to.

This method answers the question: How far have we come?

In this case, we would find that consumer prices have risen 8.2% since September 2021. That’s very high inflation, but it’s lower than the 9% year-on-year increase recorded in June, which was a 40-year high.

If we looked just at the year-on-year increase in the CPI, we might agree with the Federal Reserve’s assessment that there hasn’t been an “appreciable decline” in bringing inflation down to the 2% target.

The year-on-year perspective is good for seeing how far we’ve come, but it’s not so good at predicting where inflation is going, because it’s essentially a backward-looking measure. It gives equal weight to inflation in September 2021 and inflation in September 2022. Yet the inflation rate from a year ago has little bearing on what the inflation rate will be going forward.

The best predictor of this month’s inflation rate is last month’s inflation. The CPI is dominated by so-called sticky prices that don’t change very often. Inflation is pretty persistent from month to month.

What’s inflation doing lately?
So if we wanted to know how hot inflation has been running lately, we’d look at a shorter period of time, say, one month. The media frequently report the CPI this way, using the month-to-month percentage change rather than an annual rate.

In this case, the data would say that the CPI rose 0.4% in September after a 0.1% increase in August.

But using the monthly percentage change seems like a weird choice when we use annual rates for the year-on-year gain. It’s like talking about miles-per-hour and then switching to feet-per-second.

That’s why many analysts prefer to convert the monthly change into an annual rate so that it’s comparable to the year-on-year inflation rate. The data say that the CPI rose at an annual rate of 4.7% in September versus the 17.1% pace in June, which was a 17-year high.

The monthly data seem awfully noisy. So let’s find the underlying trend by taking a three-month average to smooth out the bumps. In this case, the data say that the CPI rose at a 2% annual rate from July through through September, down from 11% in June and 11.3% in March, which was a 41-year high.

This perspective answers the question: What’s happening with inflation yesterday, today and tomorrow?

If we look at the three-month smoothed annual rate, we might disagree with the Fed about how much progress they’ve made. Going from 11.3% in March when the Fed started raising interest rates to 2% now isn’t nothing. It looks like — dare we say it? — progress.

The Fed has actually hit its 2% target over the past three months, but of course the Fed is concerned that inflation could accelerate from here, especially in the hugely important shelter category, where hot inflation for the next year or so is baked into the cake.

What question do we want to answer?
All these measures of CPI are correct; they just come from a different perspective. Which one should we pay attention to? The one that says no appreciable progress has been made, or the one that says some-but-not-enough progress has been made? If we have a bias toward which story we want to tell, the answer is obvious.

But if we want an honest account, we’ll use the perspective that answers the question we are asking and let the chips fall where they may. (What you don’t do is start with the answer you want and then work backwards.)

That’s why I think the best way to think about the inflation we’re seeing now — and which is likely to persist in the near future — is to look at the three-month smoothed, seasonally adjusted annual rate.

That perspective is a lot more honest than the other way, and it’s a lot more hopeful, as well."|0.77|418.0|0.0|418.0

The dollar rally may be set to continue as limits on quantitative  tightening bind other central banks before it binds the Fed. The [tail risks of QT](https://www.barrons.com/articles/federal-reserve-quantitative-tightening-stock-market-51662736146)  have first appeared in the gilt market, where significant price  volatility prompted official intervention. What appears to be a  liquidity issue will ultimately become a financial stability issue as  investors discover their “safe assets” are not safe. These concerns may  prompt a policy response similar to that seen in Japan, where the price  of sovereign debt is explicitly supported. Just as yield curve control  led to significant Yen weakness, so a similar move by other central  banks would also severely weaken their currencies. This post describes  the link between bonds and financial stability, notes the existence of a **central bank “put” on bonds**, and suggests other central banks would likely cave first.

## When “Safe Assets” are not Safe

A  steady upwards march of sovereign yields would likely lead to financial  instability by pushing some financial sector entities into insolvency. [Global regulations post-GFC](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm?m=2572) mandated many of these entities to hold sovereign debt as safe assets, but **sovereign debt is actually not safe**.  They are free of default risk but can still suffer equity like price  declines with volatility that approaches that of crypto. Recently, some  investors in longer dated gilts were pushed dangerously close to  insolvency and saved only by [emergency central bank intervention](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/30136/documents/174584/default/). Note that losses from bonds can be redistributed through the financial system using hedges, but **not eliminated**.

Financial crisis can arise when investors discover their safe assets are in fact not safe. The [GFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008)  arose in part because highly rated private label MBS securities that  were considered safe were actually risky. The sudden repricing of those  securities raised widespread solvency concerns that precipitated into a  run on the financial system. Similarly, the [European Sovereign Debt Crise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis)  arose in part because the debt of peripheral European sovereigns were  considered safe when they were actually not. The repricing of peripheral  debt raised solvency concerns of the European banking system and also  led to a run on the financial system. The setup today appears similar,  but this time may be different.

## From Periphery to Core

Financial  stability concerns will likely force all central banks to eventually  support the bond prices of their respective sovereigns. Policymakers  vividly remember the [collapse of Lehman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers) and will do whatever it takes to avoid a repeat. The prospect of a financial crisis led the BOE to immediately postpone QT and [roll out unlimited bond buying](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-28/boe-to-carry-out-purchases-of-long-dated-uk-bonds-to-calm-market),  with the promise that the purchases are temporary. Their actions pumped  up gilt prices and restored the solvency of some investors, but it is  not clear if the price declines were merely due to illiquidity.

Market  prices are ultimately determined by supply and demand, and these  factors continue to suggest higher global yields. Central banks, who  were large and price insensitive investors, are no longer buying. At the  same time, net issuance in developed markets remains high from fiscal  spending. The proximate causes of gilt market volatility was an  anticipated surge in issuance to fund energy subsidies and tax cuts, as  well as impending BOE gilt sales. But a similar event could easily take  place in other markets. For example – central banks have been the  overwhelming buyers of Spanish and Italian bonds but have now stepped  back. The higher yields we see may be the market clearing prices and  persist absent official intervention.

## From Rates to FX

A  central bank that rolls out support for its bond market is likely to see  their currency depreciate. The potential policy options range from  sterilized and limited QE to yield curve control, which is the policy of  the BOJ. The result of YCC in Japan was tremendous Yen depreciation as  investors moved out of Yen and into foreign currencies in pursuit of  higher returns. That is the predictable outcome of any form of bond  price support, which would mechanically widen interest rate  differentials. The last jurisdiction to restart asset purchases would  likely experience the most currency appreciation.

The Fed is likely to be the last major central bank to backstop bond  prices due to the relative strength of the U.S. financial system. After  the BOJ and BOE, the ECB looks poised to be the next central bank forced  to shore up its bond market. The financial sector is opaque, but [market pricing and commentary](https://asiatimes.com/2022/10/global-margin-call-hits-european-debt-markets/)  appears to be indicating growing concerns over the health of European  financial institutions. European banks and pension funds are large  investors in European sovereign debt, and likely nursing significant  losses. Once Eurozone yields are suppressed then a widening yield  differential to Treasuries suggests continued dollar strength.

The actions of foreign central banks will also be supportive of the  Treasury market, but eventually the same problem will appear in the U.S.  Global bond markets are tightly interconnected and stability in foreign  markets will help stabilize Treasury yields. However, the supply of  U.S. Treasuries from fiscal spending and QT is very large even as prior [marginal buyers are no longer buying](https://www.barrons.com/articles/federal-reserve-quantitative-tightening-stock-market-51662736146). Eventually, the Fed will also have to step in too."|0.79|22.0|0.0|22.0

Also, from what I understand, the way housing is measured is via a survey of homeowners asking them how much they would ask in rent if they were going to rent their home. We have all heard how the monthly payments on mortgages are skyrocking thanks to higher interest rates which are now hovering around  7%. So if a person who bought a house in 2021 gets surveyed for the CPI and their mortgage payment is $1500 they would indicate in that survey that they need at least $1500/month in rent to cover that mortgage. If that same house was bought today and the payment is now around 100% higher than it was in 2021 that has got to show up in their response to the CPI survey question.  Wouldn't they need at least $3000 a month in rent to cover their mortgage expense? Thats a 100% increase in a 30% CPI component in 2 years. This seems huge to me.  

I realize they don't only survey **new** home buyers, but at some point people who are buying at these higher rates are going to become a bigger portion of the survey population and its going to have an impact.

VTI is of course Vanguard's total stock market fund for the US stock market while VT is Vanguard's total stock market fund for the Global stock market.

***Quick Note:*** *I swear it is just a coincident that I picked Intel as the company to use for my analysis practices; It was the first company that came to my mind ahahahah*

# Some Briefing

I made adjustments and fixed some numbers from my last analysis. The Final Price is the average of all the evaluation methods listed.

* *Graham Fair Value Formula*
* *CFO Evaluation*
* *Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow*
* *Dividend Discount Model*
* *Total Payout Valuation Model*

**Changes from the previous post:**

* **Use of Annual Data**: In the last one I used quarterly data and forecasted it as it was annual lol (what an idiot)
* **Use of Unlevered Free Cash Flow**: I used Free Cash flow to do DCF in the last one
* **Use of Growth Rate calculated by me**
* **Tax of 8.46%** calculated by me, in the last one i just guessed one randomly loool
* **Fixed Unlevered Beta**: Used MCap and Long tern &amp; Short Term Debt to calculate Unlevered Beta instead of using Shareholders Equity

**Final Introductory Notes:**

* **I did not compare Intel to is competitors** nor the industry sector, i plan to, this is just a quick analysis
* **I didn't do the Scenario Analysis** to forecast the revenue from Intel's product segments, i factored all the possible variations in sales with a conservative estimate of the company growth of 0.71%, the number is based on its last year's net earnings. The growth rate of 0.71% is used in every valuation methods used. Note: Analysts growth rate for the next 5 years for Intel is: -0.16%
* To better calculate the growth rate, i need the percentage of earnings that are not distributed to investors. I calculated the retained one as 71.59% and the distributed portion of 28.41%. I am not sure if this is correct, thus i assumed a retention rate of 5% to be conservative, if you have some indication please do not restrain yourself thanks!
* In the Dividend Discount Model, i used the calculated company growth rate of **0.71%** and not the average of the last 9 years of 5.64%. This is due to the fact that i see it as an unreasonable growth rate for dividend for the next near future. This model is based of Gordon's Growth Model (with constant growth in dividend).
* **As Discount Rate, i used mainly CAPM** form most of the evaluation methods, even tho i calculated WACC, i used it only for the Total Payment Valuation Method.
* **I made also a Risk Analysis**, but i think it is fucked up, and thus it shall not be considered at all and skipped lol
* **Company has a cash burn rate of 0.50** and 6 months remaing, i dont know why, it seems odd not gonna lie but i still have to figure out what is wrong. It is calculated on FCF of 9,662,000 thousands and Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands :/

# Ratios

*Quick Note: this is just indicative, i know i need more ratios and i need to compare them with industry and competitors to better have an adjusted commentary on Intel's ratios, in the next post i will add more ratios like: ROIC, Accounts Receivable Turnover, Inventory Turnover, Accounts Payable Turnover, Debt to Equity, Quick Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio, Price to Book ratio, P/E etc (this list is not biding, some ratio listed could be not included), i will try to compare some with its historical variations.*

|Ratio|Numbers|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Working Capital**|2.10|The company can cover its short term expenses with its current assets|
|**Acid Test**|0.18|The company cannot cover its short term expenses with only its cash and cash equivalents|

Note: The Ratios section can be skipped.

# Risk Analysis

Following are factors that can impact the company Free Cash Flow:

* **Inflation rate increases**: Last Month's inflation decreased just a little bit, but that doesn't indicate that it will plunge soon, high probability to see it increase in the near future.
* **Unanticipated effects of interest rate hikes**: We know that the FED is trying everything to fight inflation, even spending and injecting more cash in the economy! We expected the last rates hike, and we expect another one soon.
* **Geopolitical events**: one word: \*reads it with Trump's voice\* ***China!***
* **Sales forecast, cost estimates, and cash conversion cycle inaccuracy**: It is forecasted by Intel itself a decrease on sales for the next near future due to demand decrease.
* **New competitors entering the market or taking market share**: AMD is smashing it and Intel is stagnating.

**Risk in Numbers (a historical overview)**

By observing the yearly variation of its Free Cash Flow, we can extrapolate some statistics.

* Average variation of Free Cash Flow for the last 10y: **8.18%**
* Variance of the data set: **10.57%**
* Standard Deviation: **32.51%**

*You might have some visualisation problems if you are from mobile, just scroll right the table*

|Method|Comment|
|:-|:-|
|**Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula**|Used in Value Investing taking in count EPS, growth rate and AAA bond yield. As for Intel's current situation, its value shall be round $33.14 in normal market conditions.|
|**FCF Evaluation**|Taking in mind CFO for 29,991,000 thousands, CapEx of 20,329,000 thousands and Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands, Fair Value is 38.98 in Normal market conditions. Some said that Cash &amp; Cash equivalents is around 50B, but in the balance sheet i see only the Total Current Assets around that number. This gives us a price of $38.98|
|**Discounted Unlevelead Free Cash Flow**|This model observe past Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Forecast the growth of it for the next 5 years. Growth rate is a conservative 0.71% putting Fair Value Price for the next year to $19.22. Note that the future is unpredictable and this model shall use different growth rate for each year forecasted. The value is calculated assuming that the current market condition persists for the next 5 years.|
|**Dividend Discount Model**|This model observes the historical variation of Yearly Dividends. It is based on the principle that a Company Value is due to the Present Value of all its future dividends. Gordon's Growth Model is the DDM assuming a constant growth of the dividend and this DDM is based on that assumption. The fact that 5% growth is not sustainable in current market condition, i sued the calculated growth rate that i made, 0.71%, giving us a Value of $24.09 assuming a constant growth of dividend by that rate. This is conservative estimate.|
|**Total Payout Valuation Model**|This method is an alternative to DDM and try to extrapolate the Fair Value from its dividend payout. This method is the only one where i used WACC as discount rate. Why? cause the formula i got raid WACC instead of a general ""discount rate"" loooool.|

# Conclusions

As i stated, **this is just a preliminary analysis**, *i still have to integrate some data, ratios and take in mind many other variables!*

Intel is surely lagging behind it competitors and falling in the ""***Too Big To Fail***"" mentality which makes them too complacent and lazy in doing things good. I can's comment on management cause i still have to check it. Short Term and Long Term Debts are increasing, surely due to this year shenanigans in the overall market. We can observe a small increase in Unleveread Free Cash Flow and PP&amp;E. The company so far has paid dividend regularly, so if it is in severe situation, we shall expect it to stop distributing earnings, until then, we shall not be alarmed.

We can expect Intel to stay undervalued for a while, macroeconomics sucks.

**In conclusion**, *Intel is following market movements and is in a geopolitical crossfire, which affects is competitors too. We shall not forget that it is in danger regarding lagging really hard behind competitors, they need to invest more in R&amp;D and Marketing, cut inventories and operational expenses, i sense some inefficiency in the Business Structure.*

Inflation-adjusted [Series I savings bonds](https://www.wsj.com/articles/series-i-savings-bonds-what-you-should-know-11652834560?mod=article_inline) have been the most enticing place to park your cash this year—[nearly 10% interest](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-safe-investment-that-will-soon-yield-almost-10-11649769505?mod=article_inline), backed by the U.S. government, the safest investment around. In a few weeks, a little of the luster will fade.

I Bonds would likely pay about 6.4% interest beginning Nov. 1 if the consumer-price index rises as economists expect by 0.2% monthly and 8.1% year-over-year. [Savers loaded up on I Bonds](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-savings-bonds-for-protection-against-inflation-11643850044?mod=article_inline) when the rate leapt to 9.62% in May, the highest interest rate since I Bonds were introduced in 1998. 

September CPI figures, which are used to compute the I Bond rate for the six months beginning in November, are set to be released Thursday. Bonds bought from May through the end of October will earn 9.62% for six months before adjusting to reflect the new inflation data.

Even at a lower interest rate, I Bonds are likely to offer a yield that is at least 2 percentage points higher than a 30-year U.S. Treasury bond and more than 40 times the average U.S. savings-account interest rate.

I Bonds could pay more than 6.4%, even if inflation comes in as expected: The rate on I Bonds includes a fixed rate for the 30-year life of the bond and an inflation-adjusted rate that changes every six months. The fixed rate has been 0% since May 2020, and the last time it was above 1% was in 2007. The Treasury Department sets the fixed rate at the discretion of the treasury secretary.

* Move comes a day after a sell-off in UK government bonds pushed up the country’s long-term borrowing costs

The Bank of England has widened its buying programme to include index-linked gilts in an effort to counter what it warned was “dysfunction” in the market, a day after a sell-off in UK government bonds pushed up the country’s long-term borrowing costs.

In a statement on Tuesday, the BoE said the additional move would “act as a further backstop to restore orderly market conditions by temporarily absorbing selling of index-linked gilts in excess of market intermediation capacity”.

“The beginning of this week has seen a further significant repricing of UK government debt, particularly index-linked gilts. Dysfunction in this market, and the prospect of self-reinforcing ‘fire sale’ dynamics, pose a material risk to UK financial stability,” the Bank said.

The BoE’s latest move follows Monday’s launch of a new short-term funding facility to avoid a “cliff edge” when the central bank’s £65bn emergency bond-buying programme ends this week.

The Bank also said it was prepared to step up the pace of purchases before its bond-buying programme expires to £10bn per day, but bought just £853mn on Monday.

The emergency bond-buying programme was put in place after Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s “mini” Budget on September 23 sparked a sell-off in UK government bonds."|0.98|528.0|0.0|528.0

* Collateralized loan obligation prices have been hit hard by a slump in the British pound and the unwinding of U.K. pension investments
* Weakness in the CLO market may also have a knock-on effect on leveraged buyouts, including the financing for Elon Musk’s planned purchase of Twitter.

Fallout from the crisis in U.K. financial markets has hit a faraway corner of Wall Street: the trillion-dollar market for collateralized loan obligations.

Once a niche product, [CLOs are now widely held](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hunt-for-yield-fuels-boom-in-clos-1508673601?mod=article_inline) by investors around the world, including the British pensions, insurers and funds that got caught by [the recent crash in U.K. currency](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-england-to-buy-bonds-to-stop-crisis-spread-11664360313?mod=article_inline) and government-bond markets. Many of them sold CLO bonds to meet margin calls, sending prices of the securities tumbling well below their intrinsic value, analysts and fund managers said.

Some U.S. investment funds rushed to snap up the bonds at what they considered incredible bargains.

“It was the heaviest selling pressure we’ve ever seen,” said Tom Majewski, a managing partner at Eagle Point Credit Management, a Greenwich, Conn.-based investment firm specializing in CLOs. Eagle Point purchased about $80 million of CLO securities in the seven trading days ended Oct. 5, double the amount it would normally buy in a seven-day period, he said.

In recent weeks, trading of the CLO bonds most commonly held by pensions and insurers hit its highest level since March and April of 2020, according to analysis by The Wall Street Journal of trading data reported to a U.S. regulator. CLO prices stabilized last week after falling to their lowest level since mid-2020, but the selling continued unabated. Average daily trading in the first week of October was around $1 billion, twice the daily average over the past 12 months, according to analysis by the Journal.

The surge of activity took place while global markets—with the exception of the U.K.—were far calmer than at the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The S&amp;P 500 lost **7%** in the past three weeks, compared with 16% in March 2020.

Rising turmoil in CLOs shows how [fluctuations of normally placid interest rates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/britains-financial-disaster-is-a-warning-to-the-world-11664596851?mod=article_inline) in developed economies are rattling financial markets in unexpected ways. Forced selling by U.K. investors has also hit corporate bonds, stocks, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, investors and analysts said.

CLOs are a sliver of assets held by U.K. pension funds that try to guard against changes in interest rates through so-called liability-driven investment strategies. Con Keating, head of research at Brighton Rock Group, said he estimated them to be a maximum of 5% of assets under management.

Pensions and others had invested £1.6 trillion ($1.8 trillion) in LDIs by 2021, data from trade group The Investment Association show. In the relatively small market for CLOs, sales a percentage of that size have the ability to shift prices, unlike in larger markets for government bonds and stocks.

Weakness in the CLO market may also have a knock-on effect on leveraged buyouts—a lucrative business for Wall Street—because the investment vehicles purchase about 60% of the loans backing the deals.

CLOs are investment vehicles primarily run by alternative-asset managers like [Blackstone](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BX) Inc. and [Carlyle Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CG) Inc. The firms sell bonds and stocks to outside investors, then use the money to buy junk-rated corporate loans, which pay interest that is redistributed to holders of the CLO bonds and shares. Investors piled into CLOs over the past decade, [sparking worry of excessive risk taking](https://www.wsj.com/articles/financial-engineering-made-risky-loans-seem-safe-now-they-face-a-huge-test-11584702000?mod=article_inline), but they held up in the 2020 market panic, [making them even more popular](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clos-wrap-up-record-year-11640637572?mod=article_inline).

Most CLOs issue bonds of different rank: Those with triple-A credit ratings get paid first, while junior bonds rated as low as double-B wait in line to receive payment. Insurers and pensions favor the higher-ranked CLO bonds because their credit ratings satisfy regulatory guidelines and because they pay higher yields than corporate and mortgage bonds with comparable investment-grade ratings.

Heavy selling of CLOs started the week ended Sept. 23, when the [pound hit a 37-year low](https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-the-u-k-really-depend-on-the-kindness-of-strangers-11663851588?mod=article_inline), forcing U.K. investors that use derivatives to hedge foreign-exchange risk to sell assets to cover losses, said Wayne Dahl, a managing director at Los Angeles-based Oaktree Capital. The deluge intensified the following week, when prices of U.K. government bonds tumbled, triggering margin calls on LDIs, held by pension funds.

“That generated a ton of emails internally,” Mr. Dahl said. “We’ve definitely been buyers.”

About $13 billion of investment-grade CLO bond trades were reported in the U.S. during the past three weeks, according to analysis by the Journal of a database maintained by Interactive Data Corp. and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That is the highest volume since a three-week stretch in March and April 2020 when about $15 billion changed hands.

CLO prices have dropped to their lowest levels since May of 2020, according to an index of the securities operated by Palmer Square Capital Management. The firm’s investment-grade CLO bond index traded at 88.7 last week, down 4% since the start of September.

Some bond prices slipped even further, particularly those of European CLOs that were heavily owned by U.K. investors. The double-A-rated bond of a euro-denominated CLO managed by Investcorp Credit Management dropped about 5% in late September to roughly 90 cents on the dollar, according to data from KopenTech LLC. A spokeswoman for Investcorp declined to comment.

Falling CLO bond prices make it more expensive for CLO managers to borrow money to launch investment pools, reducing new issuance. Fewer new CLOs means fewer buyers for the “leveraged loans” investment banks sell to help private-equity firms fund their takeovers at a time when debt investors are already worried about a potential recession. 

Banks that financed Vista Equity Partners and Elliott Management Corp.’s $16.5 billion buyout of Citrix Systems [took a roughly $500 million loss](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citrix-debt-deal-prices-with-large-losses-for-banks-11663769143?mod=article_inline) on related loans sold in September amid weak investor demand. The market will face an even bigger test when banks [try to place $6.5 billion of loans](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-revived-twitter-deal-could-saddle-banks-with-big-losses-11665069334?mod=article_inline) for Elon Musk’s planned $44 billion purchase of [Twitter](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TWTR) Inc.

“From a CLO manager’s perspective, the selloff isn’t helpful,” said Lauren Basmadjian, a partner at the [Carlyle Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CG), one of the world’s largest CLO operators. “What our market needs is stability to issue CLOs.” 

But Carlyle also invests in CLO bonds and from that standpoint, the forced selling by U.K. institutions is a windfall, Ms. Basmadjian said: “We’ve definitely been adding exposure over the last month.”"|0.91|728.0|0.0|728.0
t3_y154c7|1665482724.0|investing|The tracking error for INDY, the leading US ETF tracking India's Nifty 50, is quite inaccurate.|"A friend pointed out that [INDY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239758/ishares-india-50-etf), the third-highest [India-focused ETF](https://etfdb.com/etfs/country/india/) in terms of average trading volume tracking the Nifty 50, has a 5-year annualized return of 6.29% but an India-domiciled ETF like the [ICICI Prudential Nifty 50 index fund] (https://www.icicipruamc.com/mutual-fund/other-funds/icici-prudential-nifty-etf) returns 12.7% over the same period. 

So a US$1,000 investment in INDY would have grown to US$1,356 in five years. 

The same amount in INR in 2017 (INR65.1 to USD) - INR65,100 - would have grown to INR118,358 or US$1,438 which is an annualized return of 7.5%. 

That's a pretty significant tracking error. I'm not sure if the tracking error is similar for other iShare products and I wonder if I'm missing something. 

I wonder if there's a US-listed ETF that better tracks the Nifty 50 which is like India's version of S&amp;P 500.

Not just that, these foreign ETFs have an expense fee of 0.89% but Indian ETFs are just 0.05%! 

edit: Sorry about the title. It should read ""The surprisingly high tracking error shows that INDY, the leading US ETF tracking India's Nifty 50, is quite inaccurate.""

edit 2: Earlier, I tried to compare a US-listed ETF with a SIX-listed synthetic fund but turns out they both have the same tracking error. I figured an Indian ETF would be alien to r/etf which seems to be mostly frequented by people from US/Europe but that only made things more confusing. Sorry! I maintain that foreign ETFs appear to have a tracking error of 100bps. I just want to understand how that might have come about

edit 3: Clarified that INDY and Nifty 50 track the same 50 companies so the dollar-adjusted return should be identical."|0.54|1.0|0.0|1.0

Good Evening folks!

*I am a student that has recently found a passion for financial analysis and evaluation of companies. In fact, i would like to be a Financial Analysis my self in the future, thus i am practicing with some fundamentals and analysis for now! Sharing here so you can judge and maybe give some advice c:*

*So, let's start!*

# CAPM and Beta

* **Levered Beta**: 0.71
* **Unlevered Beta**: 0.56
* **CAPM**: 7.22% which will be used in the Discounted Cash Flow

&amp;#x200B;

# Evaluation Methods

To evaluate the fair price per share i used 3 approaches and the calculated the average of them:

|Method|Price|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Adjusted Graham**|$34.39|Used the Adjusted formula which has: P/E of 7; growth rate of 1%; AAA Bond yield of 4.77%|
|**CFO Evaluation**|$26.56|7.22% Discount rate and 1%growth rate. It gives a MCap of 108.88 B|
|**Discounted Cash Flow**|$37.13|Here i used analysts growth rate for next year and projected the growth rate of 17% for 5 years. (I did not discounted debt from it)|
|**Average Price per Share**|$32.69|The Average price of those 3 methods|

**Current price is $25.20**, which puts Intel in the **Undervalued** category

**Edit:** *if i use my growth rate of 1% also for the DCF, we have a price of* ***$14.99*** *for the Discounted Cash Flow method, bringing the* ***Average Price to $25.31***, that is interesting hm

&amp;#x200B;

# Risk Analysis

By Observing the historical variation of the Free Cash Flow of Intel for the last 13 years, we have the following data:

|Risk Free Rate|3.89%|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return (consensus)|9.87%|
|Average Return|8.18%|
|**Adjusted Return**|**4.30%**|
|Variance (risk rate)|10.57%|
|**adjusted Risk**|**6.68%**|
|Standard Deviation|32.51%|

The company doesnt have that much risk based on historical data set, which without factoring possible outliers in the future, we can declare the stock a low risk stock, with its **adjusted risk of only 6.68%** and an **adjusted return of 4.30%**

&amp;#x200B;

# Ratios

|Cash Burn Rate|0.82|The company is burning its Cash and Cash Equivalents in an unexpected rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Month Remaining**|9.84|The company can cover its short term expenses only for 9 months more without taking any debt|
|**Working Capital**|1.86|The company can cover its short term expenses with its current assets|
|**Acid Test**|0.16|The company cannot cover its short term expenses with only its cash and cash|
|**ROE**|\-0.45%|Non that bad but not good|
|**ROA**|\-0.41%|Non that bad but not good|

# Ratios Comments

* We can clearly see that the company cannot cover its short term dues within **9 months** only by its Cash, and if the company doesn't do something, which they will, it can go tits up.
* Its current assets do cover its short term expenses if Cash isnt enough, liquidation of current assets cn cover it.
* Acid Test tells us that they will take some short term debts to cover the short term expenses.
* ROE and ROA arent that bad, they tells us that the company is in a situation between falling and recovering.

# Conclusions

As we can see from this quick analysis, the company isnt in that great shape, but still, it is not dying neither! Taking in mind the macroeconomics and geopolitics factors, it is reasonable the current short term down trend of the stock.

* We can see this with the **CFO analysis**, which factors only the current CFO and project it t the near future, this gives us the indication that in the short period, the stock will continue to drop in value following the overall market trend.
* With the **Adjusted Graham formula**, e can see that the long term intrinsic value of the company is much much higher that the current one.
* Meanwhile the **Discounted Cash Flow model** suggests us a price near the Adjusted Graham ones, but this shall be take in consideration if we have a FCO average growth of 17% for the next 5 years, which is hard with the growing competition.

I will set its fair value as the average of those 3 results: **$32.69** (this price valuation doesnt take in count future and possible developments, good or bad, and it is the value of the company based on todays data).

**Risk Analysis** was used to determine whether this is a dangerous investment, with turns out to be not. Intel has a low market risk: **6.68%** (Variance - Risk Free Rate). This result is understandable due to the fact that our modern world runs on chips. which intel is a manufacturer. We can expect at least a 30% surprise maximum variation maximum for the FCF variation factoring unexpected events.

**My overall Conclusion:** Expecting some news from the company about its current short term expenses, probably some cuts or more workers laid off. In the short term the price is destined to plunge more, but in the long run i still see a good value in it. I would by in, average down probably, and hold for at least 5 years before thinking of selling.

So I’m a student with a tuition loan and maintenance loan. Tbh I don’t really need the maintenance as I’m living from home and have plenty savings from my job. In the current market, the only use I see for my maintenance loan money is to invest it which seems fitting in the current downturn. I’m not going to need this money anytime soon (at least 1-2 years) so I was thinking of just putting it in a company I’ve done plenty research on (I’ve been investing for the last 2 years). My parents say it’s better to get the loan in the current economic environment as anything could happen. With the rising interest rates im not so sure, Mabye I should try cancel the rest of the payments?

Ideally I’d want to DCA into a US company such as GOOG, AMD or MSFT. However given the £ is down so bad, any gains in the stock will be somewhat offset by the (hopefully) rebounded £ in the future. 

Now I realise these type of companies can be volatile so my other thoughts were buying some beaten down blue chip UK stocks such as TSCO, GSK, SBRY, RIO, AV. If they go down, I’m happy to hold while receiving dividends. There’s some potential upside in the stock too and there’s no currency risk.

&amp;#x200B;

Published: Oct 10 2022 12:25PM

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.bmwe.org/secondary.aspx?id=700](https://www.bmwe.org/secondary.aspx?id=700)

&amp;#x200B;

October 10, 2022

&amp;#x200B;

BMWED membership voted against ratification of the tentative national agreement reached with the Class I freight railroads, sending the two sides back to the bargaining table and resetting the countdown to a potential work stoppage.

&amp;#x200B;

“The majority of the BMWED membership rejected the tentative national agreement and we recognize and understand that result,” President Tony D. Cardwell said. “I trust that railroad management understands that sentiment as well. Railroaders are discouraged and upset with working conditions and compensation and hold their employer in low regard. Railroaders do not feel valued. They resent the fact that management holds no regard for their quality of life, illustrated by their stubborn reluctance to provide a higher quantity of paid time off, especially for sickness. The result of this vote indicates that there is a lot of work to do to establish goodwill and improve the morale that has been broken by the railroads’ executives and Wall Street hedge fund managers.”

&amp;#x200B;

The American Arbitration Association counted and verified the election results. In total, 11,845 BMWED members submitted ballots, 6,646 against ratification and 5,100 approving the tentative agreement. 99 remaining ballots were submitted blank or voided for some other user error.

&amp;#x200B;

“The membership voted in record numbers on this tentative agreement, exhibiting that they are paying close attention and are engaged in the process,” President Cardwell said. “BMWED members are concerned with the direction of their employers and the mismanagement and greed in which they have consistently implemented, and are united in their resolve to improve their working conditions across the entire Class I rail network.”

&amp;#x200B;

The rejection of the tentative agreement results in a “status quo” period where the BMWED will reengage bargaining with the Class I freight carriers. That status quo period will extend to 5 days after Congress reconvenes, which is currently set for Nov. 14. Assuming Congress returns to session on the 14th there could be no “self help” until after the 19th.

Cash dividends do not lower the cost basis of an investment, either when you actually receive cash or when you use the proceeds to purchase new shares. Reinvested dividends are important to include in your cost basis because dividends are taxed in the year received, and if they are not included in cost basis, you may pay taxes on them twice.
You can check out the Stock Plan Transactions Supplement for Cost Basis information. This can be found by going to etrade.com/taxcenter.

t3_xzt52b|1665341471.0|investing|Why SPY is headed lower and CPI's downward trajectory is at risk|"**Summary:** 

* Year to Date, SPY is down 24%, but we still have room to go lower.

* Thanks to energy prices, there is a possibility that inflation has not peaked yet.

**S&amp;P 500:**

* [P/E and EPS Estimates](https://i.imgur.com/8MDtsAg.png)

* As shown on the above picture, while the S&amp;P's P/E ratios have fallen to somewhat normalish levels, it remains elevated when compared to the last 15 years. The P/E multiple is a function of growth expectations and discount rates. With growth likely headed lower and rates higher, it is very likely the multiple will continue to see pressure in the near term.

* However, another big issue is the earnings portion of P/E. As you can see, analyst EPS estimates are still too high. Even if the P/E multiple remains where it is, lowered EPS estimates will be a big blow to the S&amp;P and will take the index lower. 

* These EPS fears are further magnified by [margins](https://i.imgur.com/lGzqy0f.png). Margins are at notable highs and are all but confirmed to drive lower on a combination of higher inventory, consumer resistance to price hikes, and rising wages. 

**CPI:**

*  [Chart 1](https://i.imgur.com/3wBiTyu.png) and [Chart 2](https://i.imgur.com/UZbxTJb.png)

* In the above charts, you can clearly see how CPI/PPI has performed in relation to the price of crude oil and gasoline. To put it short, falling energy prices drives inflation lower and rising energy prices do the opposite. 

* Energy remains in an extremely tight situation and the relief from the SPR releases is beginning to wear off. This is all compounded by OPEC cuts, EU energy tightness, and further shenanigans from Russia. Note that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sees higher gas prices this winter as the EU cuts back on buying Russian oil and winter forces higher heating usage. 

* Just like lower energy prices flowed through all parts of the economy, pushing back against inflation, if energy prices rise, it will have the opposite effect, potentially pushing things back higher. 

**Conclusion:**

* While many on social media would have you believe things are great and the bottom is near, we have yet to discover how much pain the Fed is willing tolerate. This doesn't even include the impact of QT, removal of cheap Russian energy, and the potential for the Chinese growth engine to stall as their property markets implode. 

* Good luck to everyone's portfolios and hope this information can be of use to someone."|0.69|41.0|0.0|41.0

We are projected to have more layoffs. Currently we have some of the highest rates of young people living at home with parents. More company’s are demanding workings back in the office and no longer allowing work from home full time. And the average home is way higher then the average wage.

When performing an DCF analysis with a WACC in the terminal value calculation, we come across the term cost of equity (COE). I understand that COE can refer to two concepts:

1. For companies: The required rate of return a company sets for new investments
2. For investors: The required rate of return for investing in a company

In calculating a terminal multiple in a DCF I assume it's the first concept one is referring to, as the WACC (which includes COE) often is found in the company's own annual report. Is this a correct assumption? EDIT: I mean, if not, if it's the second concept, the company must have some way of known at what rate it's investors require for staying invested in the company, and how would they determine this rate?

I understand that the CEO is an opportunity risk, which one uses to compare two investments with different risk profiles. But in both cases, how is CEO calculated? How does companies and investors go about determining the CEO?

Investors are primed for any bit of good news to help them forget a brutal quarter for stocks that took this year’s value destruction to $24 trillion. A resilient corporate earnings season might give them that.

The MSCI All-Country World Index just wrapped up its third straight quarter of declines, the first time that’s happened since the global financial crisis in 2008.

The 7% drop came as investors grappled with persistently high inflation, a surging dollar and jumbo interest-rate hikes across the world that threaten to choke economic growth. Alongside that, analysts have slashed profit estimates, and a chorus of US and European companies -- including car giant Ford Motor Co. -- has issued early warnings about third-quarter results. 
But one view is that this could set firms a lower bar to clear, and fuel a much-needed recovery in stocks that are currently at levels last seen nearly two years ago.

Can Stocks Avoid a Rare Fourth-Quarter Loss?

Stocks have posted 4Q declines only three times in the past 20 years.
“Investors have to ask themselves how much of the bad news has already been priced in,” said Ron Saba, senior portfolio manager at Horizon Investments LLC. “Given extreme pessimism combined with reasonable valuations, the fourth quarter could give investors an opportunity to claw back some of their losses.”

History is an imperfect guide, but past stock performance bodes well for the quarter. The S&amp;P 500 gained an average 4.1% in the final quarter during the past 20 years, while the MSCI has posted a fourth-quarter decline only three times over that period.

That’s not to say companies will get through the season with glowing report cards. There’s still plenty of hurdles that could cement 2022’s reputation as a year to forget.

For one, the era of higher costs is making it difficult to defend profitability. Firms also face tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and others as central banks keep a laser focus on taming inflation. On top of that, there’s the war in Ukraine, a severe energy crisis in Europe, and economically damaging Covid restrictions in China.

Dollar Effect

US companies with a large international exposure are at risk from a stronger dollar, as underscored by Nike Inc.’s disappointing earnings report on Thursday. 
European and UK importers, on the other hand, are dealing with much weaker currencies. UK conglomerate Associated British Foods Plc and Swedish fashion retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB both blamed the greenback for a bleaker profit outlook.
But the scale of recent analyst downgrades, as well as the market reaction to the early announcers, suggest that “some disappointments are already expected and possibly even priced in to some extent,” said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at Flowbank SA.

FedEx Corp.’s withdrawal of its full-year guidance last month sparked the biggest selloff in its shares in more than four decades. Used-car dealer CarMax Inc. sank 25% after a glum quarterly report.
A Citigroup Inc. index shows US earnings downgrades have consistently outnumbered upgrades since early June, while global 12-month forward earnings have been revised down every month in the last quarter. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Stoxx 600 are in bear markets -- defined as a drop of 20% or more from recent highs.

Global stocks' forward earnings have been cut through the third quarter

The big question in the lead-up to the next earnings season is whether this will be enough. Strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. have warned that estimates are still too high and that “we’re going to see pretty substantial reductions for 2023.”
Yet, others see reason to believe earnings can hold up for a while longer. 

“Just looking at the resilience of the US economy, there’s little to suggest that earnings would be struggling at this stage,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “We’re looking out for the guidance, mentions of margin concerns, wage costs, etc. but we wouldn’t expect that to show through at least until about the first quarter of next year.”

Bloomberg Intelligence analysts expect S&amp;P 500 earnings to have risen 2.9% in the quarter, helped mainly by the energy sector. Gina Martin Adams, BI chief equity strategist, said the absence of “economic excesses” -- such as the indebtedness seen before the 2008 recession -- could insulate US demand from a severe decline.
Energy Boost

And while European importers are smarting from a weaker euro, exporters are benefiting. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi said it expects a positive currency impact of about 10% in the quarter.
“Health care is the best sector in Europe when the dollar is rising,” said Manish Kabra, head of US equity strategy at Societe Generale SA. “A very simple trade but it always works.”

Even Morgan Stanley’s Michael J. Wilson -- a stalwart equity bear -- said US stocks are in the “final stages” of a bear market and could stage a rally near term. True to form, however, he expects the selloff to resume thereafter.
The decidedly negative investor mood could also prove to be a contrarian indicator of a short-term bounce for stocks. 

Sanford C. Bernstein strategists say their custom sentiment gauge has triggered a buy signal, meaning a “bear market rally is very possible.”
US and European stocks both fell into oversold territory last month
Some technical levels suggest markets are lining up for a recovery into the end of the year. The relative strength indexes for the S&amp;P 500 and the Stoxx 600 are at “oversold” levels. That’s marked a short-term bottom in the past. 
“We have historically terrible sentiment, stocks are looking notably cheap, the VIX is spiking and the market is being indiscriminately sold,” said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. Combined with seasonal tailwinds, all those factors “could lead to a year-end rally,” she said."|0.89|107.0|0.0|107.0

This is my strategy:

\- During a bullmarket invest in the S&amp;P 500

\- During a bearmarket just stay in cash.

I came up with this simple ""strategy"" by seeing what happened this year. It almost didnt matter in what you invested in. It all went down by a lot. Even safe havens like gold crashed. Crypto crashed, tech crashed, defensive sectors are down as well. Oil went down a lot. Unless you are some investment genius that is spending all his time analyzing and have quite a bit of luck, you are probably losing money.

When the financial markets are in general downturn, I dont understand why you shouldnt just be in cash. Because unless the whole system collapses (which you shouldnt even think about in my opinion because in this case the last thing you will think about is money), being in cash is a zero risk play. But the best thing is, it is also a high reward play, because when there is a giant crash, you can buy at or near the bottom.

You have zero stress, dont lose sleep and you dont have to spend a lot of time doing this strategy.

Is there something wrong with this strategy?

Market seems to be down, way down on ""surprise"" employment numbers today.??

The market seems incredibly bull thinking that the current US Inflation of 8.26% will drop to 2% in a matter of months? Or that just because of some labour data the fed wont hike?

Reminder, inflation only started to tick up in March 2021. Its been 1.5 years since then.

If history tells us, in the 70s and 80s, it took almost 10 YEARS from up to down peaks for inflation to get under control. They had to hike interest rates up to 20%+!!

You could argue we have more debt, but guess what we may only be able to hike to 5% due to US Debt.

Year and avg inflation that year.

1973 - 6.2%

1974 - 11%

1975 - 9.1%

1976 - 5.8%

1977 - 6.5%

1978 - 7.6%

1979 - 11.3%

1980 - 13.5%

1981 - 10.3%

1982 - 6.2%

1983 - 3.2%

1984 - 4.3%

So what the fed is trying to do, is do more with less.

Only hike up to maybe 5% and get inflation down from 8% to 2%.

if history tells us anything, its not going to be months, but years.

Fed should of starting hiking back in 2021, its way way too late..

Or if the fed doesnt hike, we all start protesting that Inflation ISNT transitory and wages hike up and inflation hikes up again and down the death spiral we go.

Some unions have already negotiated 5%+ raises and threatening job action for others... And no one is satisfied.

One of the ""start the clock"" events is shares trading -below- $1 for 30 (presumably ""calendar"", not ""business"") days -- a month.  When that happens, company gets a letter, and has 180 days to turn things around / reverse split / whatever.  Then, there's another set of conditions I don't understand, which can get them an -additional- 180 days, so a YEAR total.

I'm in no particular hurry to exit this position; OTOH, I'm a bit concerned about not being ABLE to exit when I -do- want to do so.

13 months seems like a really long grace period for a company that has a good chance of going under anyway.

So, • how long does delisting ""practically"" take?  ( • Any chance it could take just a few months, say?)  • Is it well publicised -- will I be warned?  • Is bankruptcy a bigger risk than delisting?"|0.88|12.0|0.0|12.0

**Summary/Analysis:**

To put it plainly, shit don't look good. Lots of analysts lowering estimates and forecasts, but they are still being absolutely irrational. Q3 isn't the bottom for these earnings, its just the beginning as employment hasn't even meaningfully dropped yet. All signs point to inflation having peaked, but if you paid attention to the White House's reaction to the OPEC production cut, you can tell they are very worried that energy prices will again push on inflation once the releases from the SPR end. 

Common themes across these early poor reporters seems to be a glut of inventory, a quickly deteriorating consumer, as well as extreme FX issues due to the too strong US dollar. Fedex is also a canary in the coal mine for all things ecommerce as well. Again, all this has occurred in Q3 and we haven't even seen unemployment make a meaningful rise. The Fed will absolutely not pivot anytime soon as inflation has yet to meaningfully fall (SPR releases mess with the number). If something breaks and the Fed is forced to lower rates, inflation is going to murder the economy.

My current source comes from an Econ professor at FSU who was an advisor to the FED branch in Atlanta. Here is what I found according to the Federal Reserves website.

“Why is the Federal Reserve paying banks interest?

The payment of interest on banks' reserve balances is a common monetary policy tool at the disposal of major central banks. The Congress authorized the Federal Reserve to pay interest on balances that banks hold at the Fed, effective in late 2008. Since then, the Federal Reserve has paid interest on those balances. The Board of Governors sets the interest rate the Federal Reserve pays on reserve balances (the IORB rate) to help implement the FOMC's monetary policy decisions.”

But the [Robust minus weak](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/det_port_form_op.html) factor doesn't make sense to me. From professor French website:

OP for June of year t is annual revenues minus  cost of goods sold, interest expense, and selling, general, and  administrative expenses divided by book equity for the last fiscal year  end in t-1.

To me, it should be the exact opposite intuitively. If you buy companies with weak profitability (I don't know, say AMC), they should have a *higher* risk than buying a better company with more profitability (say *Cinemark).* To me, it seems like a free lunch. You get to own better companies and get a higher return.

t3_xx6a8l|1665065570.0|investing|Eight ways Elon Musk could still get out of buying Twitter|"([Via FinancialTimes](https://www.ft.com/content/3ca480f5-3077-4d7b-83d3-21d4d68bfd7c))

Let’s start with the obvious. [Elon Musk’s written proposal](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922105787/tm2227435d1_sc13da.htm)  to Twitter promises to close the $44bn deal “pending receipt of the  proceeds of the debt financing”. The wording sounds a bit sus given  recent history, but can it really offer an escape route?

**Option 1. The banks pull out**

Musk  is on the hook for $33.5bn of financing for the Twitter purchase. An  additional $13bn of funding will be underwritten by a Morgan Stanley-led  syndicate of seven banks. The banks, having capped the maximum rate on  the unsecured LBO debt at 11.75 per cent, will be [taking a bath](https://www.ft.com/content/ef12b153-7304-49ac-b735-0584204918fa) when they try to sell it on. 

Their options to bail can be found in [Exhibit E](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922049844/tm2213189d8_ex99-h.htm),  towards the bottom of the commitment letter posted in April. Probably  the only available option at this point would be to claim a material  adverse event at Twitter, perhaps by taking up Musk’s now-abandoned  argument that it’s a great big fraud made of bots. 

This has some advantages for Musk. Having the banks lead the attack might reduce the risk of having his [cringy texts](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/elon-musk-texts-twitter-trial-jack-dorsey/671619/) read to the court. 

Even so, [as many commentators have pointed out](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-07/does-elon-musk-know-how-mergers-work),  the bots thing is transparent nonsense. And it's doubtful that the  biggest business problem for Twitter — its purchaser’s fickleness about  whether he actually wants to buy it — is a watertight reason for the  banks to pull financing.

Likelihood: **2/5**

**Option 2. Musk sabotages his agreement with the banks**

Unlikely.  The ultimate counterparty here isn’t Musk, it’s Twitter, whose  shareholders have voted by 98.6 per cent to take the money. And though  Musk was expected to sell his vision to potential second-lien debt  investors, his participation was never a contractual obligation. There’s  no useful means of self-sabotage available, as demonstrated by Musk's  sustained public shitbagging of a company he’s now being forced to buy. 

Also, underwriting losses have to be weighed against the M&amp;A [advisory fees](https://www.ft.com/content/00015fb3-03e4-492f-9f8b-448172ab4aee) due on completion. 

The  underwriters and advisers aren’t the same group, with Goldman Sachs and  JPMorgan notably absent from the debt deal, but Morgan Stanley *is*  on both sides of the transaction. And if lenders had the option to quit  based on Musk’s eccentricities, that probably would’ve happened  already.

Likelihood: **1/5**

**Option 3. Musk collapses his equity financing**

He can’t without a material pretext. That’s where we were in July, [remember](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312522176753/d283119dprer14a.htm#anxatoc283119_90)?

&gt;Twitter  is entitled to obtain specific performance or other equitable relief to  enforce Parent’s and Acquisition Sub’s obligations to cause Mr. Musk to  fund the equity financing, or to enforce Mr. Musk’s obligation to fund  the equity financing directly, and to consummate the closing of the  merger, if certain conditions are satisfied, including the funding or  availability of the debt financing.

Meaning . . . [https://twitter.com/Esqueer\_/status/1577784530076852224](https://twitter.com/Esqueer_/status/1577784530076852224)

Likelihood: **0/5**

**Option 4. Musk ignores all the repercussions and bails anyway**

It’s  a risk, sure. He’s undeniably a cheeky, unpredictable scamp who  prioritises his own amusement over regulatory obligations, etc. For Musk  to convince Twitter to drop its lawsuit then ghost all of its calls  would be in character — but it’d only result in a replay of the lawsuit  with the addition of a very irritated judge. Also, Twitter seems alive  to the possibility of horseplay, tomfoolery and monkeyshine having  reportedly already [requested court protection](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal.html).

Likelihood of an attempt: **4/5**

Likelihood of success: **0/5**

**Option 5. Filibuster**

What  if Musk’s request to adjourn the trial is approved? Deal financing  commitments expire in April 25, 2023. So, if Musk can agree a pause then  somehow stall proceedings for six months, he can walk away — maybe. 

Though  if we're realistic, probably not. Courts can grant specific performance  even after funding’s been pulled. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick  famously ordered Kohlberg &amp; Co to close its [purchase of cake decorations maker DecoPac](https://nypost.com/2022/07/15/judge-in-musk-v-twitter-case-made-rare-order-forcing-deal-to-close/),  having found that the PE firm contrived to blow up its financing with  unrealistic demands and exaggeratedly bad projections. That’s a useful  precedent for the Twitter case judge, one Chancellor Kathaleen  McCormick, who’s [had no time](https://www.ft.com/content/a400f5f3-fa3a-45af-8f79-6968157f7a4a) for Musk’s previous stalling tactics.

Likelihood: **2/5**

**Option 6. Add someone unacceptable to the ticket**

This . . .  might work? Musk can syndicate the $33.5bn of his own funding however  he likes. In May, before the scuppering efforts began, Musk snagged  commitments totalling $7.1bn from investors including Larry Ellison,  Sequoia Capital, Qatar Holding, Fidelity Management and crypto firm  Binance. 

What if some politically charged names were added to  that roster? It wouldn’t be entirely out of left field. Musk’s idea to  turn Twitter into an “[everything app](https://www.ft.com/content/a149046c-5409-4390-9cf0-bd4c2b17c251)” has an unmistakable echo of WeChat, China’s pre-eminent messaging and surveillance system, whose influence [remains under investigation](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay) by US authorities. And his unprompted [peacemaking efforts](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1576969255031296000?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) have won praise [from the Kremlin](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/10/04/kremlin-hails-musks-attempt-at-ukraine-peace-deal-a78973).

The ~~right~~  wrong co-investor might force an investigation by the Committee on  Foreign Investment in the United States, whose due process timeline  would likely crash through that April 2023 funding deadline. National  security concerns would also add a layer of complication to the court’s  view on specific performance. It’s an outlandish idea but, [given limited appetite elsewhere](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/exclusive-musk-apollo-no-longer-talks-finance-twitter-deal-source-2022-10-05/), not entirely implausible.

Likelihood: **2/5**

**Option 7. Fake death**

In 2013 Jose Lantigua, owner and CEO of Circle K Furniture in Florida, reportedly died in Venezuela of mad cow disease. In 2017 [he was sentenced to 14 years in prison](https://www.news4jax.com/news/2017/02/01/man-who-faked-death-gets-14-year-prison-sentence/).  Lantigua’s is a tragic story of snowballing debts and attempted  insurance fraud, so the comparison with Musk, who appeared to be  motivated by the lulz, isn’t perfect. It does emphasise that pseudocide  (while hypothetically possible) is very difficult. If Musk were somehow  to pull it off, he would no longer be required to buy Twitter — but any  lawyer advising this course of action is probably not a good lawyer. 

Likelihood: **1/5**

**Option 8. Actually die**

A  better strategy, but still not fail-safe. It’s a general principle of  law that the contracts of the dead survive to haunt the living. Musk’s  estate *could* be required to fulfil his obligations, including  those made to the three Delaware holding companies named in the Twitter  deal. Whether a court would apply this principle, and how much Musk  would care about its judgment given his untimely passing, are  significant unknowns.

I took in consideration analysts growth rate estimate, we will calculate the Fair Value with both, the analysts one (**14.96%**) and the estimate of mine (**20.08%**). Following, estimate of Per Share Price with **analysts growth** rate estimate:

|Terminal Value|1,999,137,658.02|
|:-|:-|
|Enterprise Value|1,653,249,214.62|

We can clearly see that with analysts one, it is a **SELL**, but with mine it is a **BUY**.

I would like to share the Free Cash Flow Projections too but sub wont allow me to post pics :/

He'd been invested in IVV to the tune of about $50,000 for about a year or so, and then came to me a couple days ago and asked me to sell just about all of it because he's down about 13% on his investment, and he was afraid of a bear market coming up and eroding his holdings further. Despite me advising him against panicking and selling most of his holdings, he insisted I do so.

Now he's having second thoughts and asking if it's possible to re-buy everything. Obviously I'm going to have a talk with him about coming up with a sound investment plan rather than just knee-jerk reaction to the markets, but I did want to find out what the rules are in the US in terms of re-buying an ETF so soon after selling.

t3_xwrmoh|1665017476.0|investing|Making use of leverage in high risk portfolio|"My understanding of leverage is it increases both the average return and the standard deviation of returns by the same factor.

My understanding of diversification is that if you invest into assets that aren't perfectly correlated with each other it would decrease the standard deviation of returns without affecting average return assuming both of the assets had the same average return

The classic example of stocks and bonds as assets that are generally uncorrelated I would be sacrificing average return because bonds have given about a 4% return while stocks have given a 10% return. If I had then in equal parts my portfolio would give an average of 7% return and have less variability in returns because the assets aren't perfectly corrilated.

My question is if I leveraged my bond position by a factor of 2.5 bringing the bonds average return up to 10% and I had that position in equal part to my stock position would that bring the variability of returns down because they aren't perfectly correlated without sacrificing return? 

Assuming I haven't leveraged the bonds variability of returns to now be greater then the stocks i would have to look more into it for this specific example but still is my reasoning and understanding of these concepts and how to apply them correct and I just need more information regarding variability of returns if different assets"|0.58|2.0|0.0|2.0
t3_xwoyro|1665010316.0|investing|What’s your pick for a CAD-hedged inverse ETF?|"Obviously not everyone is going to agree with this analysis, but on the assumption that the world is heading towards a severe financial crisis (the likes of 2008, or a new Great Depression), inverse investing provides a spectacular opportunity. It’s essentially gambling; but there could be big gains on something like this if everything really does break from high debt and rising interest rates.

Take SQQQ for example (USD-hedged). It’s been on a steady decline since 2010, which makes logical sense because monetary policy has been loosing throughout that period and the stock market did very well. It was once at $500,000 a share and is around $50 today. Let’s say you were to invest $1500 (the 1 day instant access limit on WealthSimple) and you bought it today. Putting aside conversion, you’d get about 30 shares. Now imagine the world really does break and this were to go to just $700 a share (what it achieved in the 2020 lockdown). You would have made nearly $20,000 on this trade. 

It could go sideways, but it seems like a generational opportunity being between two paradigms. Are there any really good CAD hedged (preferably non-leveraged) inverse ETFs you’re looking throw a bit of money into right now?

According to Chibuike Oguh from Reuters, Apollo Global Management,  Inc. (APO) is backing out of Twitter, Inc. (TWTR) buyout financing for  Elon Musk. According to a person familiar with the matter, Apollo Global  Management, which was looking to provide $1 billion earlier this year  to Elon Musk for the deal, is no longer in talks with the billionaire.

Twitter shares rose more than 22% yesterday after Bloomberg reported  that Musk is proposing to acquire the company for the original offer  price of $54.20 per share.

Later, it was confirmed that Musk has sent Twitter a letter,  according to which he intends to proceed to close the Twitter  transaction on the original terms. For the last several months, Musk  tried to pull out of the buyout deal due to ongoing disagreement over  the number of spam and bot accounts on the site, prompting a lawsuit  regarding the takeover.

According to Reuters, Musk's changed decision over the deal made  Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) investors fear that the billionaire, who sold over $15 billion worth of Tesla shares earlier in the year to fund the deal,  was spreading himself too thin.

According to Dan Ives from Wedbush, Musk’s interest in closing the  deal would weigh on Tesla’s shares. ""We see lingering impacts from Musk  stock sales as a drag dissipating but the big worry is Musk juggling too  many balls at the same time,"" Ives said.

1) Compute the total return on investment of a security (or yields to maturity, I haven't understood what the difference exactly is) for bonds or the expected return for stocks.
2) Compute the risk (standard deviation for stocks but I know there are other, maybe better, indicators that I'll study soon).
3) Check the correlation of the asset's value with specific indicators and with other assets I already own If I find it.

t3_xwi7fs|1664994224.0|investing|What exactly is the FED trying to achieve|"**VERY IMPORTANT EDIT:**

**For reference to people that say that prices are not stabilizing/droping:**

CPI is measured by comparing the price of a Basket of Good to the price of the same Basket of Goods from 12 months ago. The percentage of increase is the inflation. So let's see how much does that basket cost for the months of May, Jun, Jul, Aug (Septemeber is not released yet)

EDIT 2: Made seasonal adjustments

May 2022 -&gt; 291.474

June 2022 -&gt; 295.328

July 2022 -&gt; 295.271

August 2022 -&gt;295.620

So it's not like prices have been increasing unhealthily. They're stabilizing.

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know if understand things correctly but since CPI is calculated YoY and inflation is dropping, doesn't that mean that prices have stabilized/start to drop?

I don't really understand the 2% inflation goal does that mean we're trying to get prices to be just 2% higher than they were last year instead of 8%? And is this something that will supposedly make things better? I mean with the global economy on the verge of collapse is the FED really just chasing a 6% price decrease? (I know CPI is not a real indicator to judge the price change for most goods but you get my point)

I don't know it just seems obvious to me that causing a global depression would be way worse than just accepting these price levels as a new standard since people have been forced to do that anyway.

When going over the countless documentation to certify the merger as a shareholder, a questionnaire popped up asking if I was an accredited investor. Because I don’t meet the income or net-worth requirement nor have the qualifications, I checked no. I now found out that I could have lied, as the acquiring company will only verify if they have reason to believe that I am not an accredited investor and that the document seems to remove their liability. In short, I am just getting my money returned after 6 years and won’t be able to realize a huge gain if the acquiring company goes public, as they intend to do.

Since the s&amp;p 500 outperforms the russel 3000 by at least 1% it seems like the 7-12% capital gains will likely pale in comparison to the extra growth I will get in my brokerage.

The apparent winners in the Bridgewater succession drama are co-investment chiefs and Bridgewater veterans Bob Prince and Greg Jensen, who had a public falling out with Mr. Dalio, and co-chief executives Nir Bar Dea and Mark Bertolini, newer entrants on the scene who were named to their posts in January.

[The mean since ~~1981~~ 1881 is 4.67%](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/4530/shiller-excess-cape-yield-for-the-sp-500). In July, the latest the website shows, the excess yield cape was 3.13% - a slightly lower than average yield. Keep in mind since we take the inverse of ShIller CAPE the lower number is better. Right now the CAPE ratio is at [28.21](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe). 1/28.21 gives us a 3.52% and the 10 yield treasury yield stands at [3.621%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx). ~~This gives us a -0.121% yield. One of the lowest ever. To revert to the mean the Shiller CAPE ratio has to come down to around 12, a 58% from the current levels.~~ 

~~Calculation as follows 4.67% (mean) + 3.621 (10 year yield) = 8.291. 1/8.291 = 12 (CAPE).~~

As was correctly pointed out, I took nominal 10 year yield and not real. Taking the real yield we need to use the number 1.38% instead of 3.621%. This in return means 3.52% - 1.38% = 2.14%.

Using the same formula if we were to assign a mean value to Shiller CAPE today, it would ne 16.53 and not 12, which gives as an implied drop of 42% instead of 58%. I will repeat again what I said in the comments many times, I'm not saying a 42% drop is coming. I'm not saying be short or sell everything. I'm certainly not doing that myself. This is purely for discussion purposes

This doesn’t factor in future rate hikes either.

FYI, I’m not predicting a 58% drop, I think the market is pricing a future rate ~~hike~~ cut which will make the current levels revert closer to the mean. However the risk here is that inflation is more persistent than expected and rate hikes persist. That will make people switch from equity markets to risk-free bonds and then we can expect a massive reaction in the equity markets

The numbers are total disaster. If NASDAQ will fall another 28% the TQQQ will be cleared with total 91% fall.

Investors have continued to aggressively increase their short positions in the global equity markets, Citi strategists led by Chris Montagu said in a note.

The stock market is currently being “dominated” by new short flows. Montagu notes that bearish positioning extended further last week with as much as $22 billion in new short positions added. Just the S&amp;P 500 saw $13.4 billion in new shorts added.

“Short profit levels have become the focus, with profits near 10% and, given the much larger notional exposures, risks have tilted towards short profit-taking, which may alleviate some of the recent declines,” Montagu told clients in a note.

In Europe, [Euro Stoxx 50](https://www.investing.com/indices/eu-stoxx50) is the most extended short futures market, according to Citi.

“[DAX Futures](https://www.investing.com/indices/germany-30-futures) (-2.4) have been trending in line with EuroStoxx, with [FTSE](https://www.investing.com/indices/uk-100) futures net notional positioning also in decline, however positioning is still net positive (+1.4) overall despite the significant rise in market volatility last week.”

Montagu also discussed a “difficult” September for global stocks with the S&amp;P 500 recording the worst monthly performance of 2022 after falling over 9%.

The [S&amp;P 500](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500) staged a relief rally yesterday, rising 2.59% to 3,678.43. [S&amp;P 500 Futures](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-futures) are also trading around 1.8% higher in Tuesday's pre-open trading."|0.88|508.0|0.0|508.0

t3_xv5xee|1664859582.0|investing|Why FSLR will continue to hit new ATH (all time highs) even in this volatile market|"After being mostly stuck at my job filled with endless streams of paperwork with little impact on the trajectory of humans a species to advance into the next era, I’ve got quite a bit of spare time once I’ve sped through the monotony. Investing is my thing and recently I decided to ditch whatever the heck strategies I had learnt from the thousands of investment gurus. I’m basically following just a simple set of rules, centred around the principle that every damn stock that exists, exists because it will eventually go up (creep up or shoot to the moon, whatever that’s in your cup of tea). This has been pretty consistent and giving me hope that whatever I’ve sunk into this realm of broken-hopes-and-dreams-waiting-for-vindication-on-green-days.

Here's my take on FSLR, First Solar.

Chart evidence

What? You didn’t start by describing what the business is about and how strong its fundamentals are, blah blah blah? I’m turning things around and start my analysis with hard, undeniable observations from the chart. Firstly, FSLR is showing very strong technical traits. FSLR closed up 3.29 percent on Monday, October 3, 2022, on approximately normal volume. Based on the share price being above its 5, 20 &amp; 50 day exponential moving averages, the current trend is considered strongly bullish and supports the logic that it will hit fresh at-time-highs soon. I’m also a big fan of MACD and RSI and these indicators are showing up very prominently in the last two monthly bars (in August and September 2022). Moving Average Covergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is 3.96, suggesting First Solar is a Buy. If FSLR can breach its $147.61 key resistance, then I’ll be happy like a cow over the moon. 

How does FSLR generate revenue

If it bothers you still that I haven’t mentioned about the business of First Solar and its fundamentals, well, I’m only going to touch on it briefly, to make my point that I’m technically bias (fight me). First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) is an American manufacturer of solar panels, and a provider of utility-scale PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling.

First Solar derives its revenue from two divisions (1) Photovoltaic Systems, and (2) Photovoltaic Modules. The need to shift toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy has never been more urgent, and First Solar provides a vast array of solar power solutions for commercial and residential purposes.

Does the company have an edge? First Solar’s Cadmium-telluride (Cd-Te) thin-film semiconductor technology has been outpacing the solar industry when it comes to panel efficiency gains. The Cd-Te technology has a higher theoretical upper limit for efficiency compared to silicon-based panels, and also helps cut manufacturing costs. The thin-film solar panels First Solar makes work better in extreme conditions, like in deserts or near coastlines, and that's allowed the company to charge a premium versus commodity crystalline silicon solar panels. First Solar faces intense competition from the likes of SunPower, Canadian Solar, Trina Solar, and Suntech Power in the solar energy segment.


A catalyst to the industry

President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act last month, which include climate-related provisions. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act should bring billions more dollars into the solar industry, and it'll have two big impacts on First Solar. First, there's $37 billion in clean manufacturing tax credits that should benefit First Solar's continued U.S. expansion. Second, the 30% investment tax credit was extended for ten years, which will be a helpful subsidy to First Solar's customers. This bill is a tailwind for First Solar that should incrementally help both demand and margins in the U.S. The company looks to be a big winner of the recently passed climate bill.

Investing in solar technology is key to achieving US Department of Energy (DOE) goals of cutting the cost of solar energy by 60% within the next 10 years, improving performance, and paving the way for a clean energy future.

New technology is in the works

There are two new products in the pipeline that could get First Solar into residential solar as well. The company is developing a multijunction module that it says could reach 25% efficiency (average industry efficiency is under 20%), and there's a project with SunPower to develop a dual-layer module with thin-film and crystalline silicon together. This is another growth opportunity in a new market for First Solar.

Come on people. Pump this stock up to higher highs.

I have nothing to sell to you. I’m not a guru peddling courses. If you are also looking for stocks that might push to new all time highs, help me to find others out there who might be lost and yet to find consistency in their investment results."|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0

The reason? It’s cheaper than investing in most mutual funds, there’s far less trading (which increases costs), and the primary structure that is used to invest in index funds — Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), also have tax advantages.


No one can pinpoint the exact date when it became clear that investing in index funds had won out over investing in active management, but Warren Buffett declaring it to be so was certainly a pivotal moment.

The year was 2007. Buffett had entered into a bet with Protege Partners, a New York City money management firm that runs funds of hedge funds, that an index fund could beat an active manager.

A few examples:

* PG&amp;E: Filed for bankruptcy partly after experiencing $30 billion caused by fires in 2017 and 2018. This bankruptcy filing, among other issues, has led to their stocks dropping over 80% in the past 5 years. I believe we could have priced in some of the climate risks they face through remotely monitoring infrastructure and tracking broader weather patterns in California.  
   * [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)
* TransAlta: They are a Canadian utility on the leading edge of disclosing operational risk from climate change. Even though they are good at disclosure, the following study shows that factoring in extreme weather risk into their stock price reduces the value estimate by \~31%. I imagine the effect of climate may be worse in companies with opaque communication on climate impacts on their business.

Nintendo did a stock split so that their Japanese shares split 10-1. As an American I can only easily buy ADR of Nintendo. However the ones that I own have yet to split 10-1 even though the split has already happened in Japan. My question is will the ADR split too? The ADR that I have is showing their market cap has 10x rather than just splitting which doesn’t make any sense. Hopefully this was enough so that it doesn’t get taken down for low quality and I can find the answer to my question.

Hello,

I work at an investment bank as an internal FX execution specialist and have dabbled into the equity market last year. At this point, I have aggressively saved into the equity market into declining conditions. My largest position SPY is down from a 400 basis, and I seek to put more into this market. Problem is, my liquidity is pretty much all tied up, from cash I need to pay rent/bills, emergency fund, and ESOs. have excess income of about $500 a month and I am thinking of doubling my portfolio using margin on MSFT to the tune of two round lots(200s). This way I can sell CCs if they immediately decline.

However, I would not say my risk tolerance is particularly extremely high, but the alternative would be throwing 500 a month at the market, and over a period of time, my DCA *could* be much higher than buying in bulk at one place in time.

Margin is usually touted as a trading device, but what about an investment one with a time horizon of more than 8 months.

DCA or buy now, paying $500 of margin per month in your opinion?"|0.38|0.0|0.0|0.0

My goalwas to see

1. end resulting performance of the investments over time
2. longest period of net negative returns for the positionDCA = investing a fixed amount of money on a fixed time interval regardless of price or marketconditionsMethod: allocate a fixed amount of cash to position every month. Whenever the cash on hand is enough to buy at least one share of the asset, purchase the asset at the Adj. Close price listed from Yahoo Finance historical data.

I chose investing period start times of 2000-04-01, representing someone starting investing at the peak of the dot com bubble, 2006-01-01, representing someone beginning their investments leading up to the financial crisis, 2007-10-01, representing someone starting investing at the top of the market in 2007, and 2009-03-01, representing someone nearly perfectly timing the bottom of the financial crisis.

Results:

|DCA start period|Longest negative ROI|current day ROI(%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2000-04-01|2000-09-01 to 2003-11-01|219|

|2007-10-01|2008-06-01 to 2009-09-01|150.23|

Takeaways and other info:

\- if you can stomach a 1-3  year period of negative returns, you should not be shaken even if you started investing at the peak of the latest market cycle.

\- The reason for the period of negative ROI for the investor who started at the peak of the market is because of the nature of DCA, where earlier investments have a more significant impact on the overall average compared to later additions. Investors who felt the most pain were the ones who had invested substantial amounts of money during the bull runs leading up to the crashes.

\- if you started investing near the peak of the market, DCA is a powerful tool to quickly get back to a positive ROI for the market. The stock market peaked in 10/2007 and didn't reach that price again until 04/2013. If you had DCA'd your way through the crash if you started investing at the top, you would be sitting at a ROI of 43%, with an equivalent cost basis of the market price from mid 2003.

\- if you're fearing the market may not reach it's 2021 highs for years, it's still in your best interest to keep averaging in to the market in the meantime."|0.91|278.0|0.0|278.0

What can they do?|"My parents held bonds for company called Grupo Posadas (a Mexican hotel company that recently restructured under chapter 11 in the US). The bonds were expiring soon and part of the restructuring included that Posadas would issue new bonds in exchange for the old ones. 

My parents received a letter in the mail from Posadas’ lawyers explaining what was going on, and informing them they had to write back in order to be entitled to the new bonds. The letter, titled 

&gt;&gt;*“NOTICE OF ENTRY OF ORDER APPROVING DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR AND CONFIRMING DEBTORS' JOINT PREPACKAGED
CHAPTER 11 PLAN”*,

was very legal sounding and, since my parents English is limited, they asked their financial advisor about it and whether they needed to write back. The advisor told them it was a mere formality and that they didn’t need to do anything. 

Long story short, they DID need to write back, and they lost any right to any claim to their bonds. The advisor is shrugging it off, telling them there’s nothing he can do and referring them to Posadas (who of course doesn’t want anything to do with my parents). 

It goes without saying that my parents are beyond devastated. It was their retirement money and they feel hopeless and cheated. 
What recourse do they have?

So I’ve heard the argument that ETFs are riskier than mutual funds.

By contrast, mutual funds don’t do that. 

On the other hand, some mutual funds take a few days to get your money out while ETFs are basically instant.

I’m in my early 40s, main breadwinner
with 2 small children, ~$250k combined income, $400k and 29 years left on my mortgage @2.8%, and frugal enough to have no other debt. Currently maxing out my 401k plan w/employer matching and HSA. $25k in I-bonds, $10k in HYSA, $10k in checking. Also contributing a few $100s/month each to my kids’ college funds.

My hard lesson learned was trying to make up for lost time in my IRA over the last 2 years, since I had a late start in saving for retirement. I still mostly own broad ETFs, but I sold some of my holdings to buy individual stocks. For a while, I was flying high, not realizing what a bubble we were in, and that the bubbliest ones were not buy and hold stocks. All of them are down, some by a little, some by a lot. I plan to keep holding, if only as a reminder of my hubris. Maybe some will rebound enough to make up for the ones that don’t. But I don’t see the point of selling low now. And yes, I realize they can and probably will go lower before they rebound, which may never return to ATH.

I was looking at short (1-3months) US treasuries, to take advantage of the rising interest rates for the next couple months until I return to total market ETFs. I have been looking at the following ETF: SPDR® Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill UCITS ETF (Acc) ([link to justetf page here](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?assetClass=class-bonds&amp;groupField=index&amp;country=US&amp;bm=0-3&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00BJXRT698#overview)). 

However, the funds past performance both in the Key Investor Information Document (KIID), and the graph shown on justetf reflect much more modest gains, nothing close to the current treasury yield.


(note: the currency must be switched to USD, otherwise you will be looking at a pretty flat line overlapping the USD/EUR exchange rate, which is why the ETF appears to have gone up significantly in 2022 in euros).

Where is the catch? According to [the official treasury website](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&amp;field_tdr_date_value_month=202209), the current yield for 3-Month treasuries is 3.2%, significantly more than the cumulative 0.2% rise in the ETFs share price in all of 2022.

My interest would be using it as a money market alternative, which I can't find on DEGIRO. US treasuries at 3.2% with such short duration is as ""low"" risk money as there can be right now while maintaining flexibility and immunity from continually rising interest rates crashing longer term bond ETFs.

t3_xtyml0|1664741738.0|investing|Anyone use signals or indicators to go from risk-on to risk-off?|"I was considering setting up some kind of simple system in which a signal (or combination of signals) would cause me to re-allocate my portfolio from, say, 100% equities (risk on) to 50% equities/50% short term treasuries (risk off) and vice versa, on a long-term basis. Obviously with the intent of avoiding sharp and/or prolonged drawdowns and losses.

The most common signal I am finding is to go risk off when a death cross occurs, and go back risk on when a subsequent golden cross occurs. This seems pretty simple, straightforward and robotic (which is what I'm looking for) and would have resulted in a significantly lower drawdown and fewer losses during the 2000 dot-com crash and the 2007-2009 GFC. However, I noticed this indicator lags a bit and you may already be experiencing a pretty significant drawdown by the time you would be signaled to go risk off (e.g., COVID crash in March 2020). I was also a bit concerned with using only one indicator to signal risk on/risk off.

Since I am still in the accumulation phase, I would continue to make regular contributions to my portfolio every month, only I would allocate those contributions accordingly based on what scenario my portfolio was in at the time (i.e., 100% of contribution to equities during risk on, 50/50 during risk off).

With the SPR at its lowest level in decades and new oil permits being denied by the current regime in DC (not to mention crazy geopolitical goings on), I'm concerned the price of fuel may be at astronomical levels by then. 

What would be the best way to hedge against super high fuel prices? I was thinking something along the lines of buying April calls for oil with a strike at $100/bbl. That way if the options expire worthless that means fuel should still be within a couple bucks of what it is now, but if oil moons (so to speak) I'll have profits with which to purchase the fuel for the trip... but I'm just taking a stab in the dark here.

t3_xt88kw|1664663717.0|investing|My father is exhausted, so I need to take a huge decision for my life.|" 

*Let me thank you in advance for reading my post. Your opinion or advice can change my life at this moment.*

&amp;#x200B;

I’m from Bolivia in South America, I’m 20 years old currently at University in the major of Physics. No income and the university is just 4$ dollars per semester. 

Just recently my father retired from the police and he’s really exhausted because of the 30 years of unstoppable working routing. We had a conversation days ago and he asked me if I wanted to do something with the money he saved through these years. He said there’s about 60,000$ in the bank that I can use to do something. We have **no debts nor a mortgage**.

I have to be clear, I have never focused on things related to the financial world because I was always reading about science. However, after this talk we had I started my research about things that are possible to do for someone in my place. Of course there was always the idea of starting a new business, but the problem is that in my country to do that it is really hard because of the amount of restrictions, high taxes; for any kind of business, huge time gap to get the papers needed or the money under the table you need to pay for papers and controls, that exist one time the business had open. There are more small reasons, the point is that business is out.

As my father's only condition is having at least 3% of net income per month in order to give me that money. I thought about making money on the internet, that's how I came here and learned more about bonds, stock, etc.. Sadly, most of the specific information is focused on other countries and doesn’t help me to be clear. Still I can have an idea of the options I have with this money. I’ve already done the analysis using the ‘personal income spending flowchart’, provided in personal finance, for all the members of my family. As a conclusion, **2,5% net income** of the 60K dollars is enough to us per month even using the 50/30/20 rule.

I need to add that my father has a house that is about 320k dollars and can be quickly sold for 250k; and he said that **if I reach 5% net income** average in anything I do, he will sell it and give me the money to keep doing whatever I choose. 

In brief, what I would like to know is:

First of all, is it even realistic for me that I’m just starting to learn about this world to aim for a goal of 5% net income?

If you think it is not, then maybe this ‘opportunity’ is not for me. But, if I don’t give up with this idea, is it possible to reach that net income of 3% on the internet in my country? If you don’t know or you think it is not a good idea to try that while being here, what about in the USA? I have an aunt there and she has a nice business in NY, so I do have the option of getting the work visa to go there with the money even if taxes were involved. In this case I would quit university and, if possible, I will continue after establishing a secure income (5% per month). 

Please if you need more information related, in order to give your opinion or advice, feel free to ask."|0.69|29.0|0.0|29.0

My spread is quite reasonable (I don't go all out with a high-risk spread). In fact, it's close to the same spread I had with LendingClub when they still offered the service and I was always doing fantastic. So my guess is either the pandemic mixed with inflation is leading to a huge uptick in bankruptcies and unpaid accounts or something fishy is happening at Prosper. Since the latter option wouldn't be so wise of the company, I can only assume that this many people are having trouble paying their loans suddenly (I am getting multiple emails every week).

I get it. Like with every high-probability trade, it works until it doesn't. And I also get there's no such thing as a free lunch, so I'm probably missing something. But when buying options, our max loss is defined, it's just the premium we pay. So even if the whole financial system collapses, as long as you only invest what you can afford to lose, you should be fine. Here is my potential set-up:

&amp;#x200B;

VIX is trading above 30 right now, which is perceived quite high. Let's say I buy a 30 put(cost of 940), longest expiration possible, which is 2023/06/21, or about 33 weeks from now. Break even for this trade is 25.60 at expiration. Of course if it reaches this price level before experiation, you'll make a profit since there's still time value left in the contract. But let's take this level as a worst case scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the charts, when VIX spikes above 30, it's usually for a very small amount of time, just a couple of weeks. However, sometimes it can take a while to come back down to profitable levels. For example in 1998, it was above 30 for 12 weeks and got back to 25.60 after 15 weeks. In 2002, once it got above 30, it only went down to 25.60 after 19 weeks. And those are the 2 worst cases I could find, and these are still well within the scope of our 33 weeks we have in our options contract. With 1 exception...

&amp;#x200B;

In 2008-2009, the VIX was above 30 for 35 weeks straight, only getting back to our virtual break even of 25.60 after 43 weeks! If this would happen again, our option would generate a loss if held until expiration.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have an exact exit strategy yet, because I want to see if you guys can pick some holes in my theory. But it would look something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

First 15 weeks or so, don't be greedy. VIX is high for a reason. Recession/depression like in 2008 is on the table, so take profits at a reasonable level, let's say if VIX gets back to 25. If that happens 1 month after you take the trade, you'll get 300 profit, which is like a 380% annualized return. After 15 weeks, get out of the trade at first sight of break even and don't get greedy. When the contract just doesn't want to get back to break even, look to roll the contract to a further expiration date when there's at least 2 months left in the contract, because that's when theta is going to ramp up. Sure, you might have to take a temporary loss by rolling the contract, but at these price levels, the eventual reward will make up for the debit you pay here, because VIX can't stay high forever, since the market can only fall for so long.

&amp;#x200B;

It's getting late out here, and I haven't backtested this strat for the entirety of VIX's existence (if there is enough interest I might add it later), but this strategy would have been highly profitable if you ran it from the covid-crash until now. I know, hindsight 20-20 right? If you bought a put every time VIX hits 30 and sell the put once price hits 25.60, which is our break even at expiration when buying the option as far out as possible, but will yield a massive profit if it hits that price only after a few days/weeks, it would have a track record of 20 out of 20 times!

I'm in my mid-20s and strictly a mutual fund investor. Since 2020 I've been dumping a few hundred dollars every month into their VFTAX mutual fund exclusively. I'm sitting at about 250 shares worth just under 10K. With all of the market craziness going on today I've been thinking, would it be a good idea to go into a high dividend-yielding mutual fund offered by Vanguard? I'm thinking VHYAX or VDADX. Does anyone here operate in high dividend yielding type funds? I'm considering this because owning nearly 10K of one fund nets me about $35 every three months in dividend distributions. I was okay with that initially as my sole focus starting out was capital growth, but I'm just looking to generate a little bit more from my dividends now, maybe funneling higher distributions from VHYAX/VDADX into VFTAX to start generating some positive momentum (at least to the point where I'm buying at least a whole share each quarter). I will reinvest all dividends from my brokerage fund back into my holdings and my time horizon is 20-30 years.

t3_xsa4d8|1664565945.0|investing|Stocks have a Bond Problem: Historical Performance|"I will attempt to explain the title without using graphs, because it seems the Mods do not really like such; same goes from links to sources. I will provide the name of sources and references below.

All investments are relative, thus how TINA (There Is No Alternative) came about. Over the past century, the performance of the S&amp;P 500 (Stocks) versus US Investment Grade Corporate Bond Total Return Index (Bonds), aka the Stock to Bond Ratio (Ratio), has relatively defined peaks and troughs.

Generally, when the S&amp;P 500 is greater than 1x (to Bonds), we see a long period (decade plus) of under-performance vs Bonds that can come in short order:

* June 1929: Ratio crosses above 1x
* August 1929: Ratio peaks at 1.11x
* September 1929: Ratio goes below 1x
* May 1932: Ratio is 0.19x
* January 1955: Ratio crosses 0.50x for the first since since falling below said level (April 1931)
* For this entire period: Bonds +157%, Stocks +36%

&amp;#x200B;

* October 1964: Ratio crosses above 1x (1.02x)
* October 1968: Ratio peaks at 1.31x
* November 1973: Ratio drops below 1x
* From 1978 - 1994: Ratio fluctuated between 0.64x and 1.02x (briefly over 1x), with a majority of the time the ratio resting below 0.75x
* For this entire period (through 1994): Bonds +704%, Stocks +444%

&amp;#x200B;

* May 1997: Ratio crosses above 1x
* May 2000: Ratio peaks at 1.46x
* August 2001: Ratio drops below 1x
* January 2009: Ratio bottoms at 0.51x
* For this entire period: Bonds +84%, Stocks -8%

&amp;#x200B;

* August 2018: Ratio crosses above 1x but never breaks higher like prior times
* May 2020: Ratio bottoms at 0.75x (COVID)
* August 2020: Ratio crosses above 1x
* April 2022: Ratio peaks at 1.43x
* For this period: Bonds +2%, Stocks +28% (I've group this time period together given peak levels)

Current level (September 2022): 1.25x

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If we look at the median ratio level by decade, we find the following:

* 1920s: 0.51x
* 1930s: 0.32x
* 1940s: 0.24x
* 1950s: 0.50x
* 1960s: 0.98x
* 1970s: 0.86x
* 1980s: 0.77x
* 1990s: 0.75x
* 2000s: 0.79x
* 2010s: 0.92x
* 2020s: 1.21x

Given history, it seems unreasonable to expect this level of performance in stocks relative to bonds. This is not an absolute call on stocks (bull or bear), but only relative to corporate bonds given history. Yes, the S&amp;P and the Bond Index composition has changed over these decades, however it seems fair to use this data and a just one mean of trying to identify stock values relative to other alternatives, in this case investment grade corporate credit.

Edit: formatting

Edit 2: as correctly pointed out by u/tachyonvelocity this is using the S&amp;P 500 price index and not the total return, therefore some periods mentioned above do not reflect dividends and buybacks and therefore stocks outperformed bonds (1964-1994).

But while correct, if I completed this sort of analysis I would also use a volatility-weighted, risk adjusted approach. In relative trading for me, this is the single most critical aspect. For this subreddit and for buy and hold and DCAs, it likely has no relevance. 

Hugh Hendry once gave a presentation in 2016 where he showed a chart that showed the US equities lost value to US 10y treasuries from 1971 to 2016 by 75% after adjusted for volatility… of course, as he rightfully stated and you might imagine, you’re long 10y up to you ears, but again, it puts assets on a “constant basis”. 

Ray Dalio has also tried to explain this in that a 50/50 portfolio where stocks and bonds are negatively correlated, when volatility adjusted isn’t a true 50/50 portfolio, but more 80 (stocks) / 20 portfolio."|0.8|37.0|0.0|37.0

(\*A bear market being defined as a 20% or more decline in the S&amp;P 500 from its prior peak.)  

The peak-to-trough declines for these bear markets ranged from -20% to -51%.  The VIX at capitulation\*\* ranged from 40 to 153 (!).  The maximum one-day declines at capitulation ranged from -5.3% to -21.5%.  (\*\*Capitulation was the day of highest volatility that either marked the low for the bear market or was within a few days of the ultimate low.)

The S&amp;P is currently down \~25% from its prior peak.  The maximum VIX for this bear market was 34.8 back in May (so didn't represent the low.)  Over the last week the maximum VIX has been 33.8 and the worst one-day decline was 2.4%.    

Interestingly, in all four previous bear markets the S&amp;P declined to the long-term trend line or (well) below it.  The long-term trend line for the S&amp;P is currently between 2500 and 3000, depending on your starting point.

Now, four data points isn't even close to statistically significant - this information might be meaningless in the current context.  This time could be different.  But... I do wonder if market psychology approximately rhymes during these extreme downturns and if certain characteristics must be present in order to reflect capitulation and mark a true bottom.

They've lost about 17% of their value since I bought them. I started looking at selling them to harvest losses for next year's taxes, but am struggling with how to avoid running afoul of the wash sale rule by buying something that isn't substantially identical in the view of the IRS. 

I've done this with stocks which obviously is easier, but these two funds have rather diverse holdings. FBNDX is about 40% treasuries and the rest is corporate debt and MBS pass throughs (which can obviously encompass a lot). FAGIX is lower-quality debt across a ton of sectors. 

Would selling these holdings and purchasing another fund like FBAGX or FTABX be materially different enough to avoid a wash sale? Are there tools for comparing funds through the less of avoiding wash sales?"|0.99|5.0|0.0|5.0

Natural Gas storage in Europe ~ 93%. Enough for this winter. What is the long term solution? Coal fired generation plant decommissioning in Germany and other location being deferred (but for the sake of the environment must be done).

Coal companies (Arch, BTU) are seeing much improved EPS.

BTU’s third quarter EPS is indicated at ~$2 based on ~162 million shares on an (MSN) financial website.

Other websites show ~144 million shares in the (diluted) pool. So are EPS really ~13% higher?

Institutional and Insider share holdings are ~ 82% of float. (Based on the 144 million share float)

18% of 144 million is ~26 million shares in the ‘active’ float.

As of 09/15/22 ~15 million shares are ‘shorted’.  (~58% of ‘active’ float),

Average daily trade ~ 6 million shares. (23% of ‘active’ float traded every day?)

2 1/2 days to cover short interest-if shorts were the only ones buying.

Russian long term shut out of coal sales. Coal prices near record highs, situation not to change soon.

BTU earnings more than enough to retire all debt. Two ‘parts’ of the corporation retired $20.4 million in long term debt last month.

Who is keeping the BTU price range bound? What will the breakout price run to?

How much of next years EPS will the Institutional owners push to be paid out in dividends? Could be a significant sum if next years EPS are close to this years (guidance is ~US$8.50)

$8.50 EPS on a $25 stock? (And EPS could be significantly higher depending on which share count is correct.)

I have been DCAing around £2000 a month for a while now, i will continue doing that. Its basically all ETFs.

However,  I have around a further £8000 a month to invest and around £100k in cash.

The £8k PM will grow exponentially unless a train runs me over(recession!?)

I don't really know what to do with the £8000 PM and the Cash.

1. One option is to DCA the £100k evenly and plunge the £8000 a month on a DCA basis,
   1. Risks is that its a 10 year recovery and it makes me sad
   2. We are no where near the bottom and I should have dry powder to buy under priced stocks at a later date
   3. DCA removes all thinking and i could be laughing in 5-10 years.
2. Diversify with alternatives with that amount
   1. Farmland
   2. other stuff?
3. Put it in a savings account at around 5%
   1. Boring
   2. Mitigates loss to inflation despite still losing
4. Do not invest £8000PM and £100k, instead use it as dry powder when distressed assets (houses, commercial property, businesses) become available at lower prices

Obviously, we do not know if we are anywhere near the bottom or what the recovery will look like. Over 5,7 or 10 years? At the same time the money is unproductive and losing value.

In my (often wrong) mind buying the biggest tech companies in the US seems as safe as buying VTI because there's no way tech is going away in the future - it should only get bigger.

Is there any fund or ETF which its currency is CHF that you would recommend?

I have a main exposure to GBP and EUR due to my personal situation.

I would like to avoid further exposure to GBP/EUR and also USD by pursuing CHF, but I need to be able to buy it from the UK, preferably the more companies the better, as a unique exposure to Switzerland would be ok but not very diversified.

Is there any option for doing this?

Alternatively, I could invest in individual stocks valued in CHFs or that pay dividends as CHF.

Senior banker describing the leveraged unwind in Gilts (UK government bonds) as coming close to triggering a ""Lehman moment""

&gt;That process had put pension funds at risk of insolvency, because the mass sell-offs pushed down further the price of gilts held by funds as assets, requiring them to stump up even more cash.  
&gt;  
&gt;""At some point this morning I was worried this was the beginning of the end,"" said a senior London-based banker, adding that at one point on Wednesday morning there were no buyers of long-dated UK gilts. ""It was not quite a Lehman moment. But it got close.""

Below is the full text of the central bank's statement:

&gt;""This repricing has become more significant  in the past day – and it is particularly affecting long-dated UK  government debt. Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen,  there would be a material risk to UK financial stability. This would  lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a  reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;""In  line with its financial stability objective, the Bank of England stands  ready to restore market functioning and reduce any risks from contagion  to credit conditions for UK households and businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;""To  achieve this, the Bank will carry out temporary purchases of long-dated  UK government bonds from 28 September. The purpose of these purchases  will be to restore orderly market conditions. The purchases will be  carried out on whatever scale is necessary to effect this outcome. The  operation will be fully indemnified by HM Treasury.  
&gt;  
&gt;""On  28 September, the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee noted  the risks to UK financial stability from dysfunction in the gilt market.  It recommended that action be taken, and welcomed the Bank’s plans for  temporary and targeted purchases in the gilt market on financial  stability grounds at an urgent pace.  
&gt;  
&gt;""These  purchases will be strictly time limited. They are intended to tackle a  specific problem in the long-dated government bond market. Auctions will  take place from today until 14 October. The purchases will be unwound  in a smooth and orderly fashion once risks to market functioning are  judged to have subsided.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Monetary  Policy Committee has been informed of these temporary and targeted  financial stability operations. This is in line with the Concordat  governing the MPC’s engagement with the Bank’s Executive regarding  balance sheet operations. As set out in the Governor’s statement on  Monday, the MPC will make a full assessment of recent macroeconomic  developments at its next scheduled meeting and act accordingly. The MPC  will not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to  return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in  line with its remit.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The MPC’s annual  target of an £80bn stock reduction is unaffected and unchanged. In light  of current market conditions, the Bank’s Executive has postponed the  beginning of gilt sale operations that were due to commence next week.  The first gilt sale operations will take place on 31 October and proceed  thereafter.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Bank will shortly publish a market notice outlining operational details.""

This is inline preliminary reports from Fedex and Ford. Markets, consumer, economy, FX, and treasury yields continue to deteriorate badly, however inflation is hiding much of the pain in the numbers and statistics. Also note that headline CPI is clouded by releases from the SPR which is expected to end this October and energy is likely to spike in the winter due to the current EU/Russia conflict. 

I would also like to point out recent earnings from HD and SBUX where each reported lower volume but higher sales as a result of higher pricing. Inflation is extremely embedded into our economy, yet markets have not come to terms with the pain or the time (years) that will be required to bring it back to normal levels. 

There is also a very interesting dichotomy between corporate leaders and Fed officials. While many Fed officials see a softish landing or refuse to consider the possibility of a deep recession, note that some of the biggest CEOs have flagged a hard landing as early as summer.

While the S&amp;P has begun to come off lower towards the 15xish forward multiple, it should rightfully be at a lower multiple as a result of the higher rates. Additionally, earnings expectations have yet to come down. This is partly why many major banks have begun to forecast a S&amp;P in the low 3000s.

# Global Market Stress Is Piling Up. Something Is About to Break

*Central  banks have dialed up their resolve to combat inflation in recent weeks.  In response, markets have become so unmoored a major financial and  economic crisis can’t be ruled out. That means global monetary policy  hawkishness may have hit its peak and something will eventually  break. The impact on four big asset classes will be very different.*

## Things are starting to break

It’s [absolute mayhem](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-26/why-investors-are-facing-even-more-market-instability)  in global markets right now. In the US, the S&amp;P 500 re-confirmed a  bear market after sinking through the June lows and the two-year  Treasury bond has [sold off](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/treasuries-extend-losses-driving-yields-to-new-multi-year-highs)  for a record number of days. In the UK, the currency dropped to  all-time lows against the US dollar and government bond yields mounted  their highest climb ever in a two-day period. In Europe, German 10-year  yields breezed through the 2% barrier, having started the year with a  negative yield. In Japan, the central bank was forced to intervene in  currency markets as the yen fell to its lowest against the US dollar  since 1998. Italian bonds are taking it on the chin with 10-year  government bond yields rising above 4.5% for the first time since the  height of the sovereign debt crisis in 2013.

Something is [going to break](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-23/wall-street-risks-a-breaking-point-after-week-of-monetary-mania). The Fed’s resolve will soon face [its most pressing test](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-27/the-federal-reserve-s-inflation-fight-how-far-will-it-go).  There are so many stressors piling up, it truly is the everything risk  right now. Policymakers cannot possibly put out all the fires. One of  these economic pathogens will metastasize into a full-blown crisis. And  that’s when the policy about-face will come. How this plays out in four  distinct financial markets -- equities, fixed income, currencies and  housing — will differ.

The dizzying rise in the dollar is the most worrying development because episodes of prolonged dollar strength usually [end in crisis](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/morgan-stanley-s-wilson-says-dollar-surge-tends-to-end-in-crisis?srnd=premium). The good news for fixed income investors is that a crisis would cap [bond losses](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-24/the-great-bond-bubble-is-poof-gone-in-worst-year-since-1949).  Crisis or not, stocks are still in for a slow grind as earnings  disappoint for many more quarters into the future. Housing will suffer,  too.

## The Fed is hurting housing but not labor...yet

A  litany of market strategists are screaming for the Fed to relent,  advising that inflation has peaked. But central banks can’t sit idly by  as the cost of living crisis punishes households. Much of the inflation  issue is related to supply constraints — a lack of qualified labor or a  lack of industrial capacity to meet demand. Lacking supply-side tools  and committed to bringing inflation down, central banks have decided to   crunch demand to bring it in line with the diminished supply.

When  the latest US inflation numbers came out showing core CPI at an  annualized rate of 7%, Bloomberg Economics projected that  “gas prices  will weigh on the CPI in September, while core inflation accelerates.”  Such numbers would virtually guarantee more hawkishness from the Fed —  and a rise of three-quarters of a percentage point in rates in November,  right before the US mid-term election.

So  far, the rise in interest rates hasn’t cooled the labor market though.  Weekly initial jobless claims remain low and the number of continuing  claims has actually fallen recently. That’s a good thing for laborers.  But it also adds incentive for the Fed to raise rates because of the  worry that high inflation in a tight labor market will feed through into  wages and then back into goods and services when companies pass those  wage costs onto customers.

The one area where the impact of the Fed’s rate hikes is visible is housing. Mortgage rates are now up to 6.3%, the [highest since 2008](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-22/mortgage-rates-in-us-jump-to-6-29-highest-since-october-2008).  If you look at GDPNow, the Atlanta Fed’s tracker of GDP, almost all of  the weakness is coming from housing. After the latest housing starts  report from the US Census Bureau, the most recent update said “the  nowcast of third-quarter residential investment growth decreased from  -20.8 percent to -24.5 percent.” It’s this massive reduction in  residential investment that has their GDP estimate for the third quarter  just barely positive at 0.3%. Outside of housing, the US economy is  doing just fine. So the full force of the Fed’s policy moves clearly  haven’t filtered through into the wider economy yet.

## The US dollar rules over everything

The  resilience in the US economy has allowed the Fed to grow increasingly  hawkish. The result is not just higher interest rates and lower equity  prices but also a strong dollar. That currency effect forces other  central banks to take hawkish action themselves, putting additional  downward pressure on global economies. The UK is the [perfect example](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/uk-meltdown-raises-specter-that-bond-vigilantes-are-returning).

The  Bank of England has been raising rates at a steady quarter- or  half-percentage point rate at each policy meeting. However, that pace  hasn’t kept up with the Fed, adding to the pressure on the British  pound. Then, last week, in an effort to boost growth, the new British  government announced tax cuts that [went far beyond](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-23/uk-bonds-plunge-as-uk-dmo-ramps-up-gilt-sales-more-than-expected) what markets had expected -- at a time when the labor market is tight, inflation is high and the currency is falling.

Markets  reacted negatively and violently sending the pound to a record low  against the US dollar. Bonds had their worst selloff in decades and the  stock market fell. The message is that any central bank that doesn’t  keep pace with the Fed will face the same unpalatable policy choice:  either allow their currency to weaken, hence fueling more inflation,  or take rates higher, eventually suffocating the domestic economy.

These economic strains and the associated market volatility raise the risk of [liquidity draining ](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/dollar-swaps-face-biggest-collapse-since-fed-2011-liquidity-plan) in  safe assets that will eventually produce a credit crunch. The ructions  we have experienced over the past week simply can’t continue without  something breaking. Credit crunches are inherently deflationary events.  So, if central banks press on and something does break, it will subdue a  lot of the built-up inflationary pressure, forcing an about-face in  policy.

## By the numbers

* May 2002 The last time the US dollar was stronger than today

## What comes next?

The  tricky part is knowing exactly which dams will break or when it will  happen. My base case is that we see market stresses build to a  flashpoint next quarter, forcing a climb-down from central banks and an  easing of the pace of rate hikes. Here’s how I see it playing out  in bonds, equities, currencies and housing.

In  the US government bond market, the yield curve is inverted, with  investors getting lower coupons for longer-maturity debt. This inversion  is unusual because investors need to be compensated for the risk of  holding assets over a longer period of time. It generally only happens  before recessions because markets anticipate rate cuts.

By  the time the Fed’s policy rate hits 4% in November or December, a  credit crunch will be visible and the rate hikes will slow. With 10-year  Treasury yields already approaching 4%, we’re very near a peak  in long-term yields. Two-year yields are even higher, near 4.30%,  indicating that top is also close. Getting a decent yield without  concern it will climb much further is an attractive investment. Some  investors, like DoubleLine’s Jeffrey Gundlach are [  already buying](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/gundlach-starts-buying-as-10-year-us-yields-set-for-record-spike).

In  equities, the environment is most akin to the early 2000s because the  elevated valuations of the pandemic can only be supported in the most  benign earnings environments. I expect earnings to [continue to underwhelm](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-25/nasdaq-100-faces-10-drop-as-inflation-hits-tech-profits?srnd=premium)  for many quarters to come. That will put downward pressure on  valuations, even though a whole generation of investors will continue to  buy the dip under the false premise of missing out on the next rally.

They  may be misguided. We’ve already had four months of earnings downgrades  outpacing upgrades. My colleague Heather Burke writes that “struggling  US stocks are unlikely to see much relief from the upcoming  third-quarter earnings season”. And a recession of unknown depth and  duration likely lies ahead of us. All that suggests more earnings pain  to come. Just like during the period after the tech bust in 2000, the  drip-drip of earnings misses will exact a toll on investor psychology,  grinding equities lower until we see serious capitulation. After  that, the business cycles will be hopefully long enough to build gains.  That wasn’t the case from 1999 to 2012 and that was toxic for portfolio  returns.

In  currencies, because stress is building, the US dollar is getting bid.  And that will continue until we hit the flashpoint that causes central  banks to reverse course. But the dollar’s rise has become parabolic,  suggesting the moment of truth won’t take long.

I  believe we’re nearing a secular peak in the dollar. I wouldn’t be  surprised to see it much lower from here as it was after the double top  in 2001 and 2002.

Last  but not least is housing. In the US, housing has become increasingly  unaffordable due to the double whammy of lofty house prices and  rising interest rates. That’s driving people out of the market for home  purchases, thereby increasing the demand and prices of rental units.  Rent inflation is one of the biggest problems in the cost of living  crisis.

Fed  Chair Jerome Powell said outright at the last FOMC press conference  that his aim in raising rates is to cool house prices and rents. Some  markets are [already starting to show cracks](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/us-home-price-growth-slowed-in-july-as-housing-market-cools?srnd=premium).  The decline should not be as crisis-inducing as it was in the wake of  2008 because households carry much less debt now than they did at the  peak of the housing bubble.

Nevertheless,  as housing is the middle class’ principal asset, it will inflict enough  pain on consumer balance sheets to slow consumption and, thus,  inflation.

But it’s the dollar’s vertiginous rise that mostly suggests we’re nearing peak hawkishness. It’s a sign that investors are [seeking safe assets](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/traders-who-just-want-to-survive-sit-on-5-trillion-cash-pile?srnd=premium)  as fear pervades the market. This kind of market environment can’t last  without a release valve from policy or it ends in a crisis. When the  turn comes, it will be bullish for bonds but bearish for the dollar. It  will be a while before housing and equities can recover."|0.9|1110.0|0.0|1110.0

I've been seeing a lot of posts asking about where to put cash and I never see floating rate treasuries mentioned. If purchased through an ETF like USFR, they have instant liquidity. So no lockups like CDs or buying treasuries directly.

The current SEC yield is 2.87% and has been increasing on a near daily basis. The best part about that yield increasing? The price of the ETF isn't going down as a result. This is because the effective duration is .02, basically nothing. Other bond funds have much higher effective duration and these ETFs have lost more in principle than they've paid out in interest lately. USFR's price hasn't moved in 5 years.

These should also be exempt from state tax unlike savings accounts.

The People’s Bank of China said on Monday that financial institutions selling foreign-exchange forward contracts will be subject to a 20% risk-reserve ratio, up from zero currently. The change, which will kick in on Sept. 28, will make it costlier for banks—and correspondingly, their clients—to sell yuan to buy dollars in the derivatives markets.

t3_xohbju|1664193671.0|investing|Fidelity recently released a report on the benefits of alternative investments... here's what it had to say|"Fidelity released a report in August looking at the value of holding alternative investments in a multi-asset portfolio. They looked at 16 asset classes (traditional and alternative) from 2005 to 2021, compared their performance, diversification benefits, and impact on a multi-asset portfolio.

I read through Fidelity's report and tried to distill down some of the key points that I saw. If you want to read the full article, I'll post the link at the end of this post.

**First**, Fidelity's comparison of 16 alternative investment asset classes from 2005 to 2021 showed that private equity (both buyout and venture capital) was by a wide margin the best performing asset class in terms of returns.

**Second**, the study showed that from 2005 to 2021 certain alternative asset classes, as part of a multi-asset class portfolio, could enhance risk-adjusted returns for the portfolio overall. Fidelity found that during this time a portfolio containing alternative assets had “a higher level of return for the same unit of risk”, which is pretty incredible. Buyout private equity and venture capital had top-quartile performance amid a downslide in US public equities, and venture capital displayed above average diversification benefits while buyout had limited benefits to diversification.

**Third**, Fidelity points out that while alternatives may have performed well over the time period, access to them was historically largely limited to ultra-high net worth individuals and institutions. These institutions hold a significant amount of alternatives as well. In fact, “on average, pension funds reported a 22% allocation to alternatives, while endowments and foundations reported an average allocation of 32%”. There are several factors contributing to everyday investors' limited access to alternatives, but over the past few years there have been exciting efforts to increase alternative investment options for everyday investors.

Presumably this is the maturity of the basket of the underlying t-bills. No big deal about the per-share ""decrease"" because you get the interest payout about a week later.

But what about something like SHV or SHY? Do these also essentially do the same thing? Are the dividends also paid out on a semi-regular schedule, coinciding with the maturities of the underlying t-bills? SHV's chart (less than 12 months) looks like maybe it has this pattern. But SHY's chart does not??

Asking because if the 1-3 year treasuries are yielding better than the 0-3 month treasuries, why not just buy the SHY ETF so I have some liquidity, say 6 months from now? Is SHY not exactly like the underlying treasury because the underlying note that's paying 4% isn't going to be distributing that interest until 2024-2025? So what's getting distributed today are the interests on the ones bought 1-3 years ago (and I presume at a much lower rate)?

Right now the strategy signals keeping your money in bonds.

As a Singaporean, I wonder if anyone from outside of US has tried to implement this strategy, and with what ETFs/funds, while keeping expense ratios, withholding taxes etc. to a minimum. And, how would you calculate the signals, what assets or funds would you use to determine signals? Any discussion on this and variants of this strategy are welcome.

My take is CSPX, EIMI, and IB01 (0-1y US treasuries). I'm worried about longer-duration/aggregate bonds, as they have dropped in the current bear market instead of keeping its value. Signals wise, I'm thinking to use the original signals, without considering forex impact.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-the-stock-market-dip-is-backfiring-this-year-11664064845?mod=hp_lead_pos1

It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  

Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&amp;P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.

The extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.

Major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived—and an attractive opportunity to buy.

The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&amp;P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.

Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans’ behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. 

The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. 

“I’ve really been taking a beating,” said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. “I’m uncomfortable.” 

Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market—including on Friday—only to see his positions quickly sour. 

Other investors said they are hanging on and haven’t yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&amp;P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. 

***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&amp;P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. 

U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. 

Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** 

Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders’ activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.

***“The frenzied, frothy behavior isn’t there,” said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. “But that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.” ***

Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. 

On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed’s interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. 

The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. 

Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. 

“I fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,” he said. 

Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. 

Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters’ college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. 

“I started off feeling very greedy,” Mr. Tafarella said. “I thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.”

Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. 

One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed’s rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.

Claire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  

“I think it’d be silly to sell stocks,” Ms. de Weerdt said. ***“I don’t care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they’re like in 30 years.”***

I want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ummmp3/buy_the_dip_believers_are_tested_by_markets/

&gt;&gt;Individuals’ willingness to backstop markets throughout this year’s selloff demonstrates that the group—for now—has been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&amp;P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.

Also, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.

That is something I haven't seen nicely explained here. I'd like to pinpoint my observation here and I'd appreciate your feedback.

Last week I've seen the biggest Slovenian bank (that is the bank in the EU), NLB Banka, issuing EUR bonds with a hefty coupon of 9.721 %! The bank is not really in a troublesome condition according to financial data, even its valuation looks interesting. What is funny is that its biggest subsidiary offers 0.3% interest on EUR deposits, so being a retail saver in the bank sounds stupid. Then I figured out that these much higher coupon payments in the future will screw bank profit margins! The bank has Standard &amp; Poors's long-term rating BBB and Moody's Baa1. Luckily for investors in this bank, the next bonds to reprogram come in 2025 and these bonds that are just reprogrammed are less than 20% of the overall bank's bonds.

**What this means for other companies:**  yields are going really up fast, and it could really affect all leveraged companies. As REITs are typically highly leveraged,  I wanted to calculate what could happen to their profits. Let's take into example $AMT, American Tower, market cap 106B. It has 40.8B in debt and if interest rates stay high, once they'll have to issue new bonds with higher interest rates. Let's say that over time they reprogrammed all debt with 250bps (that is 2.5%) higher interest rate, that is 1.02B higher interest payment per year. That would be 1.02B less net income (last year net income was $2.57B, this is 40% lower projected net income). AFFO (Adjusted Funds for Operations) in 2021 was 4,373M, so over the long term, AFFO could go down 25% with 250bps higher interest rates) . And $AMT is in relatively good financial condition, it has 6.4x debt to EBITDA, and 60% debt to assets, once you make the same calculations into some highly leveraged mid-caps and small-caps, things start to look very ugly.

Bonds rates went really up and continue that trend and I think we should prepare for a really hard landing. That means I think that SP500 will go down at least 10% more, as the shit still didn't hit the fan."|0.63|2.0|0.0|2.0
t3_xnezf0|1664085293.0|investing|Is the US withholding tax for dividends technically a participation fee? From the perspective of foreign customers of US brokers.|"I'm talking about the 30% withholding tax. You may get a reduced rate of 0% or 15% depending on your country of residence, through the W-8BEN form. I could be wrong about the numbers. It's from memory, and I couldn't find the complete list again.  

Anyways, it doesn't seem like non-US residents can claim those tax back. And whether they can be credited on your local tax payment probably depends how nice your tax bureau is and the agreements between the country and the US. Especially in some countries where officially investment with foreign brokers is banned or has disadvantageous tax treatment. For example, a few Asian countries block Interactive Brokers for example, so legally gray area.

----

I remember reading that you basically need to pay the full 30% amount somehow. For example, if you got the reduced 15% rate, you still need to pay 15% tax locally. Like the countries with 0% US dividend withholding tax, has a 30% dividend tax in their local tax law. Perhaps that's the spirit of the double taxation treaty, but obviously it doesn't work that way. Because of uninformed or antagonistic taxmen.

Now with 4% in 2yr TBills, I think ”hey, a risk-free return amidst a red wedding”…

But at the same time, as we are testing June’s lows, I have to think that this is a major dip like I’ve never been able to invest in before (for not being liquid during COVID crash). And thus im torn. Risk free return, or buy the dip. 

I think my other logic pushing me to stay in DCA mode for equities is - “do I think that we will EVER get back to ATH?”  If yes, then that’s a guaranteed 20%+ return at current price. 

On that same logic, the only justification I can see for someone not being in equities is they must think we will never get back. I am sure this is flawed, but it’s what has me torn. 

Not really a question in here. I suppose just curious what everyone’s take is now that we actually have a risk-free return that is getting to the point of serious consideration."|0.92|172.0|0.0|172.0

I've been very supportive of the moves Zaslav has made, but if this rumour is true, it puts his streamlining of properties and focus on brand improvement in very different lights.

This move would make a certain amount of sense as well, given how Universal was already looking to acquire Fox back in 2016 when bidding against Disney. Different companies and situations, but clearly Universal Comcast have enough capital to finance such a deal and it would further consolidate the entertainment and streaming sectors into few key companies.

There's a lot more in this article that I've not gone into, but this to me is by far the biggest (potential) revelation here.

So what do investors think? I haven't seen any discussion on this, and I don't know whether a sale to Universal (with anti-trust issues aside) would be beneficial for the share price as it currently stands."|0.71|6.0|0.0|6.0

Sterling dipped as low as $1.1032 at 12:00 p.m. London time, around an hour after the measures were unveiled in the House of Commons.

The pound has been on a precipitous fall against the greenback this year, hitting levels this month not seen since 1985.

Friday’s measures were billed by the government as heralding a new era for the U.K. focused on growth, and included a mix of tax cuts and investment incentives for businesses.


Cuts include reduced taxes on property purchases effective immediately, a reversal of the 1.25% National Insurance hike, and a 1% decrease in basic income tax. The highest level of income tax effective at £150k or more (45%) is now completely scrapped. 

So what's the play here for UK investors? Just dump into US equities? I recently rejigged my pension around to accommodate for a declining UK market and seems like that might have been the right move. I'm now about 60% in US and 10% UK, 30% rest of the world."|0.98|2524.0|0.0|2524.0

I'm a DCA fan myself for most part and mostly using TMV as a hedge/investment (50/50) but I also see lot of people switching to SQQQ (from TQQQ) while I see very little people switching from TMF to TMV.

Yes, the Fed rates are basically the overnight rates and don't directly affect longer maturity date rates, but with the Fed rates changing from 2.25% to 3% just the other day, and the Fed having the intention to go as high as 4.6% (with the current plan) for the end of 2023, I see TMF as throwing money to the firepit until we change to a more dovish scenario.

Yes, we've been having the yield curve well inverted for most of the year, and even so the 20Y bonds rate are just shy of 4%. **I just don't see all rates not increasingly proportionally** (ish) and hence TMV printing until the rates go down.

I will personally make the switch from TMV to TMF once the rates start going down but this just seems like as a safe bet as it can get.

I've been wondering about how the S&amp;P500 has performed since the Pandemic began in real terms (adjusted for inflation).  I find it quite fascinating that we endured one of the hottest bull markets in history between Q2-2020 and Q4-2021, and yet indexes are only marginally higher than they were in Q1-2020.  

I hadn't seen much data posted on inflation-adjusted returns so I've compiled them here for your commentary.  All numbers are USD and are using US inflation data based on CPI data.  


* CPI Aug 2022: **123.1**
* CPI FEB 2020: **108.6**
* Change: 123.1/108.6 = **1.1335X**

S&amp;P500:

* S&amp;P500 Today: **3758**
* S&amp;P500 Feb 2020 High: **3390**
* Change: 3758/3390 = **1.108X**

Today's inflation-adjusted S&amp;P500 price 3390 on Feb 2020 (Pre-COVID high): 3842.5

So on a real basis, we are trading \~2.2% below pre-Pandemic levels. This is a 31-month return of -2.2% in real terms (-0.85% APR). Nominally, we are up about 10.8% from the pre-Pandemic highs (4.18% APR).

NASDAQ:

* NASDAQ Composite Today:  **11066**
* NASDAQ Composite Feb 2020 High: **9750**
* Change: 11066/9750 = **1.134X**

The Nasdaq has returned very close to 0% since pre-Pandemic highs, adjusted for inflation.  It has tracked CPI nearly 1-1 over the past 31 months.  

Some thoughts and takeaways.  2020-21 felt like the second coming of the '99 Tech Bubble.  Software companies were getting 100X+ Price-Sales valuations.  Work-from-home was supposed to have advanced the technology sector by 5-10 years in the span of one.  Companies like Zoom hit $100B+ valuations.  

It's quite astonishing how quickly everything went from bust to boom to bust again.  One year ago, it would be hard to fathom how the stock market could be down (inflation-adjusted) since pre-Pandemic levels.  After all, we were still in the midst of a face-ripping bull market.  It's quite sobering to see how quickly returns can vanish and even go well-below historic averages.

Throwing all your money into the stock market in Feb 2020 would have yielded a below-average nominal return, and a negative real return.  Thoughts/commentary?"|0.88|34.0|0.0|34.0

&gt; The ""death cross"" is a market chart pattern reflecting recent price weakness. It refers to the drop of a short-term moving average—meaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity or cryptocurrency over a set period of time—below a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldencross.asp

&gt; A golden cross is a chart pattern in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) breaking above its long-term moving average (such as the 50-day moving average) or resistance level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes.

We are currently in a ""death cross"" state.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_crossover

&gt; Golden cross occurs when 50 days simple moving average crosses 200 days simple moving average from below.[1] Death cross is an opposite situation, when 50 days simple moving average crosses 200 days simple moving average from above.[2] Death cross is not a reliable indicator of future market declines.[3]

It's only fired 27 times in the past 28 years.

Should you invest when the market is in this ""death cross"" state (50 day moving average less than 200 day moving average)? Looks like a great way to avoid a ton of drawdown. I just don't know if it also gives up potential return.

Are we all just waiting for the 50 day moving average (currently at $403.24 on SPY) to cross back over to the 200 day moving average (currently at $423.36 on SPY) before going long again? Should we be short right now, or cash?

The explanations I can think of are:

1) The price movements are just the normal changes caused by supply and demand imbalances as people trade to rebalance their portfolios.

2) The price movements are mostly driven by bond traders who closely track the holdings of bond ETFs.  (But where do they get minute-by-minute information about particular ETF holdings?)

3) The price movements are mostly driven by bond traders reacting to small bits of information they come across that could affect general economic conditions.

4) The price movements are mostly driven by the trading of insiders with intimate knowledge of bond ETF holdings who are seeking arbitrage.

I'm sure you could find similar comments on a stock like META at the start of the year, but to a different extent.

Reddit is a great platform, but it's voting system hiding comments that get enough downvotes is a tremendous disservice to those trying to do well in the market. There's a reason so many people don't outperform the S&amp;P.

I am confused with how the yield works. I'll use a scenario.

If someone were to put 1 million dollars in a 4 week t-bill and at auction is was sold for 2.45%. Would the return on the 1 million be invested 24k (roughly), or is this percentage someone prorated based on an annual yield and cut into a fraction that looks something like this. 1/12th of 2.45% would be the actually return, which would be around 2k return on the 1 million invested for the 4 week term?

This has confused me for a long time. Any clarification would be much appreciated.

It has 3 mains company branches: infrastructure(constructing highways), construction and technology(improving sustainability of real estate and renovating royal palaces) and finally real estate(building houses).

When looking at the numbers of Heijmans it might look like a shell of its former self. The stock price is 13 times lower from its all time high. Revenue although sitting at a nice 1.7 billion is still less than half what it was in 2010. But is this really the case.

Being mostly focused on construction 2009 and the ensuing years hit Heijmans hard declining profits and increasing debt put Heijmans in a difficult position. So in 2016 they decided to sell of all the international parts of their company and use the proceeds to pay of their debt. Even though the company is not the size it once was it is back to being profitable. Better yet they are making just as must profit with 1.7 billion in revenue as they were in in 2007 with 3.7 billion in revenue.

But of course where is the value?:) Heijmans has a P/B ratio of 0,82; a P/E of 6.8; a P/FCF of around 5.8 and finally the enterprise value/EBITDA is 2.47. of course it’s not all sunshine and rainbows this is not a Jim Cramer stock pick 😊. The profit margin at 4% is a bit low for my liking but it’s not that surprising for big construction companies like these. If we compare it to it’s competitors like BAMNB it’s no different.

**Future**

Heijmans has been under some stress over the last 10 years but they have shown great adaptability. They are focussing on the Dutch market and that’s serving them well. Since leaving other countries and focussing on the Netherlands from 2017 their revenue has increased 17.4% and their profits by 157%. There are no signs of this growth slowing down, even covid didn’t put halt to this. Their Orderportfollio is floating at a healthy 2.2 billion. They have recently acquired Fynniq energy in improving energy infrastructure this shows Heijmans is still looking at the future and at ways to grow. The large housing shortage and high migrant intake also means the demand for houses are high and will stay so for a considerable while."|0.47|0.0|0.0|0.0

Short of a huge economic downturn, the fed is looking to push for another .5 to .75 rate increase. That will push saving/bond interest rate to be about 4-5%. USD has been on a tear against pretty much all other currencies, on average gaining 18-30% over the past 6 months. Even accounting  for the sky high inflation, the bond/saving rate and strength of USD makes oversea retirement even more attractive."|0.47|0.0|0.0|0.0

A couple of close friends have invested money in new forests in Malaysia, and I thought asking here might attract opinions. They want me to do the same, but it's very, very far from my knowledge base and so I'm really wary. Does anyone know about this - particularly as a third party would you have any rights, if your investment didn't turn out as you'd planned? Has anyone done or seen similar in other countries, and is aware of the pitfalls and benefits?

Internet dictionaries do not include any reference to this term so it seems it's one of those accepted colloquial terms. 

Here are two examples in use:

"" The company is expected to grow earnings at a relatively fast clip, which helps it maintain it status as a growth company.""

"" The trader managed to scalp 5 trades at a [with a] 25% clip ""

Is ""clip"" a reference to clipping a coupon from a bond, as in that's your return rate on principle? 

This is one of those terms I don't feel comfortable using bc I'm not exactly sure what it means and why ppl choose to use it. It def seems like lingo, of the type you might hear at a casino that regulars use but aren't really words. Like ""Yo Eleven! ""

Page 4, the expectation is that all through 2023 the rates will increase to potentially 5%...

Meaning the FED wont pivot till late next year..

So does the market seem surprised that it hiked it 0.75% and remains dovish 

I am confused. 

Meanwhile FED is finally removing 95Billion every month from its balance sheet...

That will hurt market alot harder.|"[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/21/the-fed-forecasts-hiking-rates-as-high-as-4point6percent-before-ending-inflation-fight.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/21/the-fed-forecasts-hiking-rates-as-high-as-4point6percent-before-ending-inflation-fight.html)

So the Fed now wants to hike to 4.6% and keep it there through 2023!

That's a lot higher than the 4% expected and will certainly affect the economy a lot harder not just in the short term but also next year and beyond.

Borrowing rates for consumers and companies will go up much higher and stay high which obviously will hurt spending therefore slowing down growth.

Higher rates means for most companies it becomes a lot more difficult to borrow money to finance further growth hence companies are preparing for the slowdown and scaling back.

Also the variable rate debt lots of companies have accumulated over the past years of easy money will really start to hurt now as this type of debt is linked to rates.

It's important to understand this is not just a short term effect. Rate hikes have impact on companies many quarters after they take affect. Most talking heads in the media but also permabulls here on reddit seem to ignore that and just keep talking up the markets so beware. A short term rebound does not mean it can't go lower afterwards!

Would not be surprised to see another short bear market pump before it goes much lower again once companies start revising their earnings forecast to the downside.

Powell trying to talk up the markets afterwards clearly doesn't help anymore. He should stick to what FOMC members have decided instead of trying to give it a ""rosy"" spin.

Final point, so we now have a problem in the housing market, credit market (too much borrowing going on) and in the equity markets (earnings compression coming). Not sure how that combo will end but don't have a good feeling about this. Hope this won't be 2008 all over again or worse.

That's in a nutshell what the Fed decided today and its future impact on the markets. Stay careful and don't be a mindless sheep."|0.92|1400.0|0.0|1400.0
